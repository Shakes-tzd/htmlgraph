## Dependency Maximization

### Rich Library (Current: 40% utilized)

**In Use:**
- Progress bars ✅
- Status indicators ✅

**Starting in Phase 1A:**
- Tables ⚠️
- Panels ⚠️

**Planned for Phase 1:**
- Tree visualization ○
- Syntax highlighting ○

**Available for Future:**
- Live updates
- Columns layout
- Sparklines
- More...

**Target:** 70% utilization by Phase 2

### Pydantic (Current: 0% integrated)

**Planned for Phase 1:**
- CLI argument validation (type-safe)
- Data models for Features/Tracks/Spikes
- Computed fields for derived properties
- Type hints throughout SDK

**Planned for Phase 2:**
- Graph node/edge models
- Relationship validation
- Advanced querying

**Target:** 50% integration by Phase 1, 70% by Phase 2

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1A Success
- Rich tables render correctly in terminal
- Error panels display with proper formatting
- No breaking changes to existing commands
- All tests pass (unit + integration)
- Feature marked DONE in HtmlGraph

### Phase 1B Success
- Errors display with context in Rich panels
- Suggestions are helpful and accurate
- Traceback filtering works correctly
- --verbose flag shows full traces
- All tests pass
- Feature marked DONE in HtmlGraph

### Phase 1 Success (CRITICAL)
- Pydantic models integrated and working
- Rich tree visualization functional
- CLI arguments type-safe and validated
- Computed fields working correctly
- All tests pass
- Phase 2 can begin
- Rich utilization: 40% → 70%
- Pydantic integration: 0% → 50%

### Phase 2 Enablement
- Phase 1 COMPLETE
- ~80% of all features complete
- Foundation set for Phases 3-4

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Phase 1A/1B (additive work, no breaking changes)
- CLI refactoring (isolated work)
- Phase 2 (builds on solid Phase 1 foundation)

### Medium Risk
- Phase 1 (Pydantic integration complexity, CLI arg parsing refactor)
- Rich tree visualization complexity

### Blockers
- None identified
- All phases can proceed with clear dependencies
- Phase 1A/1B can run mostly in parallel

---

## Key Insights

1. **Dependency Potential:** Rich has 20+ features available. Each phase unlocks 20-30% additional capability.

2. **Critical Bottleneck:** Phase 1 is the foundation for Phases 2, 3, 4. Cannot bypass it.

3. **No Parallel Speedup:** Cannot parallelize Phase 1 work. Must be sequential and focused.

4. **Next Week Matters:** Phase 1 completion next week determines if we can do Phase 2 in week 3.

5. **Foundation is Strong:** CLI operations layer exists, Rich partially integrated, SDK fully functional. Building on solid ground.
