## Migration Phases Overview

### Phase 1: REST API Restoration (CRITICAL)
**Effort:** 2-3 days
**Risk:** Medium
**Impact:** High (users dependent on REST API)

**What's Needed:**
- Restore 8 REST endpoints in FastAPI
- Add CORS support
- Write comprehensive tests
- Verify backward compatibility

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/python/htmlgraph/api/main.py`
- Create: `tests/api/test_rest_api.py`
- Reference: `src/python/htmlgraph/server.py` (lines 398-1268)

**Go to:** SERVE_MIGRATION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md → Phase 1 section

---

### Phase 2: File Watching Restoration
**Effort:** 1-2 days
**Risk:** Low
**Impact:** Medium (developers expect --watch to work)

**What's Needed:**
- Integrate GraphWatcher into FastAPI
- Implement graph reload callback
- Restore `--watch` flag
- Test file watching functionality

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/python/htmlgraph/operations/fastapi_server.py`
- Modify: `src/python/htmlgraph/cli.py` (argument parser)

**Go to:** SERVE_MIGRATION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md → Phase 2 section

---

### Phase 3: CLI Argument Compatibility
**Effort:** 1 day
**Risk:** Low
**Impact:** Medium (backward compatibility)

**What's Needed:**
- Make `--graph-dir` work with FastAPI
- Add `--quiet` flag
- Update argument validation
- Test all combinations

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/python/htmlgraph/cli.py`
- Modify: `src/python/htmlgraph/operations/fastapi_server.py`

**Go to:** SERVE_MIGRATION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md → Phase 3 section

---

### Phase 4: Legacy Server Removal (BREAKING CHANGE)
**Effort:** 0.5 days
**Risk:** Low (only deletions after Phase 1-3 complete)
**Impact:** Major (breaking change for major version bump)

**What's Needed:**
- Delete legacy files
- Remove obsolete imports
- Update documentation
- Release as major version

**Files to Delete:**
- `src/python/htmlgraph/server.py` (1,600 lines)
- `src/python/htmlgraph/operations/server.py` (300 lines)
- `tests/operations/test_server.py` (300 lines)

**Go to:** SERVE_MIGRATION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md → Phase 4 section

## Recommendations Summary

### PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION
✅ **Proceed with complete migration to FastAPI**

**Rationale:**
1. FastAPI is modern and actively maintained
2. WebSocket support enables real-time features
3. Query caching improves performance
4. Async architecture scales better
5. Single codebase reduces technical debt
6. Effort is manageable (4-6 days)

### TIMELINE
- Week 1: Complete Phase 1 (REST API)
- Week 2: Complete Phase 2-3 (File Watching + CLI Args)
- Week 3: Testing & documentation
- Week 4+: Phase 4 (cleanup in next major version)

### BREAKING CHANGES
Users will need to:
1. Update `--graph-dir` to `--db {graph_dir}/index.sqlite`
2. Update REST API calls to use new endpoints (or rebuild index)
3. Update CLI scripts that depend on specific arguments

## Making Decisions

### Decision 1: Proceed with Migration?
- **YES** → Read SERVE_MIGRATION_ANALYSIS.md section "Recommended Migration Path"
- **NO** → Not recommended; document decision and technical debt implications

### Decision 2: Which Phase to Start With?
- All (recommended) → Start with Phase 1 (REST API)
- Urgent fix only → Start with Phase 2 or 3 as needed
- Scheduled work → Phase 1-3 in next sprint, Phase 4 in next major version

### Decision 3: Break Changes Acceptable?
- **YES** → Proceed with all phases including Phase 4
- **NO** → Keep both servers during transition period
- **GRADUAL** → Deprecate legacy server over 2-3 versions

### Decision 4: Resource Allocation
- **Full-time** → 1 engineer, 1-1.5 weeks (4-6 days dev + 1-2 days testing + docs)
- **Part-time** → 1 engineer, 2-3 weeks (15-20 hours over time)
- **Distributed** → 2 engineers, 1 week (parallelizable tasks)

## Summary

This is a **complete migration analysis** for the HtmlGraph `serve` command. The migration from SimpleHTTPRequestHandler to FastAPI is **70% complete** but missing critical features:

- ❌ REST API endpoints (need to restore)
- ❌ File watching (need to restore)
- ⚠️ CLI argument compatibility (needs updating)

**Recommendation:** Complete the migration over 2-3 weeks with 1 engineer.

**Start Here:** Read SERVE_MIGRATION_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.txt, then SERVE_MIGRATION_ANALYSIS.md.
