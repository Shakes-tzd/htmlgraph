## Key Findings Summary

### The Problem
Dashboard Activity Feed doesn't show events from Task() delegations (subagents)

### The Evidence
- **Codex subagent created:** 2,962 events
- **Features created:** 10
- **Feature creation events:** 1,369 (46% of work)
- **Database status:** All events stored in SQLite
- **Dashboard visibility:** 0% (hidden)

### The Root Cause
Dashboard queries only the main session (`WHERE session_id='sess-fd50862f'`)
Subagent events are in a separate session (`0e6fd1e4-bc71-4424-88d4-3e88562ba5ed`)
No link between the Task() event and the subagent session_id

### The Solution
Link subagent sessions to parent tasks via:
1. Short-term: Add session lookup API + dashboard detail
2. Medium-term: Extend schema with delegation fields
3. Long-term: Redesign for unified event stream

## Key Takeaways

1. ✓ **Events ARE being recorded correctly**
   - All 2,962 subagent events in database
   - Complete JSONL files maintained
   - No data loss

2. ✗ **Events are architecturally isolated**
   - Separate session files per subagent
   - Dashboard only queries main session
   - No parent-child relationships

3. 🔗 **Solution requires linking**
   - Connect Task() event to subagent session
   - Add delegation tracking fields
   - Update dashboard queries

4. ⏱️ **Timeline is flexible**
   - Short-term: 1-2 hours
   - Medium-term: 3-5 hours
   - Long-term: 1-2 days

5. 📊 **Impact is significant**
   - 26% of work invisible
   - 1,369 feature events hidden
   - 10 features created but process unknown
