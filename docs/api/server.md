# Server

Development server for the dashboard.

## Overview

The server module runs the HtmlGraph FastAPI application, which provides the REST API, WebSocket and SSE endpoints, and the activity feed backend used by the dashboard. The primary interactive dashboard is served by a separate Phoenix LiveView application at `http://localhost:4000`; the FastAPI server (default port 8080) handles the data layer.

## Usage

### Command Line

```bash
# Start server on default port (8080)
htmlgraph serve

# Custom port
htmlgraph serve --port 3000

# Custom host
htmlgraph serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080

# Auto-reload on file changes
htmlgraph serve --watch
```

### Python API

```python
from htmlgraph.server import serve

# Start server
serve(
    graph_dir=".htmlgraph",
    port=8080,
    host="localhost",
    watch=False
)
```
