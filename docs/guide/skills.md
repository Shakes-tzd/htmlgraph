# Skills Overview Guide

## What Are Skills?

Skills are specialized commands and guides that extend HtmlGraph with focused, reusable capabilities. Think of them as expert consultants you can summon for specific tasks:

- **Skills provide progressive disclosure** - Start simple, dive deep only when needed
- **Skills integrate with HtmlGraph** - Seamlessly coordinate with tracking, delegation, and analytics
- **Skills are discoverable** - List, search, and learn at your own pace

When you need guidance on a specific area, invoke a skill to access expert-level documentation and decision frameworks—without overwhelming yourself with unnecessary detail.

## Decision Tree: Which Skill Should I Use?

Use this flowchart to find the right skill for your task:

### "I'm planning a complex workflow"
→ Use **`/orchestrator-directives`** for:
- Deciding whether to delegate work
- Understanding parent-child session relationships
- Cost optimization strategies
- Complex multi-agent coordination patterns

**Example:** "I need to run 5 parallel test suites and then deploy. Should I delegate?"
```bash
# Get orchestrator guidance
/orchestrator-directives
```

### "I need to choose a model for a subagent"
→ Use **`/multi-ai-orchestration`** for:
- Selecting spawner types (Gemini, Copilot, Codex, Claude)
- Cost vs. capability tradeoffs
- When to use cheap exploratory models vs. expensive reasoning models
- Spawner compatibility with your task

**Example:** "Should I use Gemini (free) or Claude (expensive) to explore the codebase?"
```bash
# Get spawner selection guidance
/multi-ai-orchestration
```

### "I need to run tests/linters before committing"
→ Use **`/code-quality`** for:
- Running ruff, mypy, pytest in the correct order
- Fixing linting errors systematically
- Type checking and test failures
- Full quality gate workflow

**Example:** "My type checker is failing. What's the right fix order?"
```bash
# Get code quality workflow
/code-quality
```

### "I need to release or publish code"
→ Use **`/deployment-automation`** for:
- Version number management
- PyPI publishing
- Plugin updates (Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- Release checklists

**Example:** "I need to bump the version and publish to PyPI."
```bash
# Get deployment workflow
/deployment-automation
```

### "I'm stuck debugging something"
→ Use **`/debugging-workflow`** for:
- Research-first methodology (read docs before guessing)
- Systematic root cause analysis
- When to use debugger vs. researcher agents
- Using HtmlGraph spike documentation

**Example:** "My hooks aren't loading. I've tried 3 fixes already."
```bash
# Get debugging methodology
/debugging-workflow
```

### "I need to keep multiple docs synchronized"
→ Use **`/memory-sync`** for:
- Central documentation (single source of truth)
- Platform-specific file generation
- Automated consistency checking
- Documentation maintenance patterns

**Example:** "I updated AGENTS.md but forgot to update CLAUDE.md and GEMINI.md"
```bash
# Get memory sync workflow
/memory-sync
```

/help
```

### Invoking a Skill

```bash
# Simple invocation
/orchestrator-directives

# With context (optional)
/code-quality --for-python-projects
```

### Progressive Disclosure

Skills follow a **progressive disclosure model**:

1. **Quick summary** - Start with the basics
2. **Decision guide** - Help you make choices
3. **Examples** - Real-world usage patterns
4. **Details** - Deep technical information

You don't need to read everything at once. Start with what you need, dive deeper as needed.

## Skill Integration with HtmlGraph

### Tracking Your Skill Usage

When you use a skill to solve a problem, document it in HtmlGraph:

```python
from htmlgraph import SDK

sdk = SDK(agent="claude")

# Create a spike documenting your learnings
spike = sdk.spikes.create(
    title="Learned debugging workflow - resolved hook loading issue"
).set_findings("""
Used /debugging-workflow skill to systematically diagnose hook loading problem.

Key learnings:
1. Research first - read Claude Code hook documentation
2. Check all hook sources (not just .claude/hooks/)
3. Understand that hooks from multiple sources MERGE
4. Verify with /hooks command

Issue was resolved by: Removing duplicate hooks from hook sources
""").save()
```

### Orchestrator Directives Integration

When delegating complex tasks, reference the orchestrator skill:

```python
from htmlgraph import Task

# Orchestrator coordinates based on skill guidance
Task(
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    prompt="""Using /orchestrator-directives skill guidance:

    Task: Run comprehensive test suite in parallel
    Scope: tests/unit/, tests/integration/, tests/e2e/

    Success criteria: Report pass/fail counts only
    Time limit: 10 minutes total
    """
)
```

### Code Quality Gates

Integrate code quality skill with deployment:

```bash
# Before deploying, ensure all quality gates pass
# (Follows /code-quality skill workflow)
uv run ruff check --fix && \
uv run ruff format && \
uv run mypy src/ && \
uv run pytest

# Only then deploy
./scripts/deploy-all.sh 0.9.4
```

# Step 2: Create feature tracking
# (Use HtmlGraph SDK as shown in delegation.md)

# Step 3: Execute with proper delegation pattern
# Task(subagent_type="...", prompt="...")
```

### Example 2: Debugging a Mysterious Error

**Scenario:** Your tests are failing with an unclear error

```bash
# Step 1: Use debugging workflow
/debugging-workflow

# Learn:
# - Research first methodology
# - Systematic error analysis
# - When to use debugging agents

# Step 2: Document findings in spike
sdk.spikes.create("Debug: test failure in X").set_findings(...)

# Step 3: Don't guess - research and understand root cause
```

**Scenario:** You need to publish version 0.10.0

```bash
# Step 1: Ensure quality with /code-quality
/code-quality

# Step 2: Follow deployment automation
/deployment-automation

# Step 3: Execute steps in order
