## 🔄 INTEGRATION WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Review (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Read ORCHESTRATOR_OPTIMIZED.md (main prompt)
- [ ] Review ROUTING_DECISION_FLOW.md (visual guide)
- [ ] Validate spawner selection logic against your use cases

### Step 2: Test (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Make 5 routing decisions using new system
- [ ] Compare to old system routing
- [ ] Document any differences or confusion

### Step 3: Deploy (15 minutes)
- [ ] Choose integration path:
     - Quick: Use QUICK_REFERENCE as --append-system-prompt
     - Standard: Use OPTIMIZED as default system prompt
     - Full: Use both + DECISION_FLOW as learning guide
- [ ] Update system prompt in Claude Code
- [ ] Verify routing works with 2-3 test cases

### Step 4: Measure (2 weeks)
- [ ] Track routing accuracy
- [ ] Measure decision speed
- [ ] Gather feedback from first 10-20 delegations
- [ ] Adjust if needed

### Step 5: Optimize (Ongoing)
- [ ] Monitor metrics monthly
- [ ] Collect patterns in failed delegations
- [ ] Update routing rules based on learnings

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Which file should I use?**
A: Start with ORCHESTRATOR_QUICK_REFERENCE.txt for quick decisions. Set ORCHESTRATOR_OPTIMIZED.md as your default system prompt.

**Q: Can I use both the quick reference and optimized version?**
A: Yes! Optimized as system prompt + Quick reference as printed card = best of both.

**Q: How long does it take to learn the new system?**
A: First 5-10 decisions take 1-2 minutes each with reference. After 20-30 decisions, routing becomes automatic (<10 seconds).

**Q: Will this break my existing workflows?**
A: No. The optimization is backward-compatible. All routing decisions map to existing spawners and tools.

**Q: What if I disagree with a routing recommendation?**
A: The decision matrices are guidelines, not rules. Use them as starting points. Document any patterns where you deviate and report them for optimization.

**Q: Can I customize the routing logic?**
A: Yes. The documents provide templates. Adapt to your needs, but measure the impact on success rates.
