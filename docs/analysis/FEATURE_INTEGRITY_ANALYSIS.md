5. UNTRACKED FEATURES (no agent_assigned) (64):
   Status=done: 31
   Status=todo: 33

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:

Primary Issue: 65 features have data integrity problems (73.0%)

1. Abandoned Work: 33 features in 'todo' status with 0 work (37.1%)
   Possible causes:
   - Features created but deprioritized
   - Features not assigned to anyone
   - Work started in external system, not tracked here


3. Status Drift: 14 features marked 'done' but have incomplete steps
   Possible causes:
   - Features marked done without completing all steps
   - Steps added after feature marked done
   - Steps not properly tracked as completed

4. Missing Agent Attribution: 64 features have no agent_assigned
   Possible causes:
   - Features created without SDK.create() method
   - Manual HTML creation without agent metadata
   - Agent metadata lost during file migrations

REPAIR STRATEGY:

CATEGORY 1: Auto-Fixable
  1. Partially done features → Mark status as 'in-progress' or 'done' based on step completion %
     Action: For features with >80% steps, auto-promote to 'done'
             For features with >0% steps, set to 'in-progress'
     Count: ~0

CATEGORY 2: Requires Manual Review
  2. Status mismatch (done but incomplete steps)
     Action: Review each feature - either complete missing steps or downgrade status
     Count: 14

  3. Abandoned features (todo, 0 steps)
     Action: Either start work (mark in-progress) or archive
     Count: 33

CATEGORY 3: Process Improvement
  4. Add agent attribution to features
     Action: Update feature creation to capture agent from SDK context
     Impact: Prevents future untracked work

  5. Implement status sync workflow
     Action: Create hook to auto-update feature status when steps change
     Impact: Prevents status drift

RECOMMENDATIONS:

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Priority 1):
1. Fix status mismatch on 'done' features
   - Review 14 features marked 'done' with incomplete steps
   - Either complete missing steps or change status

2. Promote in-progress features
   - 0 features have partial work
   - Auto-promote >80% complete to 'done', others to 'in-progress'

SHORT-TERM ACTIONS (Priority 2):
3. Address abandoned features
   - 33 features in 'todo' with no work
   - Archive or start work within 1 week

4. Implement post-step-completion hook
   - Auto-update feature status when all steps complete
   - Prevent future status drift

LONG-TERM ACTIONS (Priority 3):
5. Enforce agent attribution at feature creation
   - Update SDK.features.create() to capture agent context
   - Make agent_assigned a required field

6. Add validation tests
   - Test for status/step mismatches
   - Test for untracked features
   - Prevent regression
