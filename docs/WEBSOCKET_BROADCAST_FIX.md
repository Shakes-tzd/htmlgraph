# WebSocket Broadcast Parent Event ID Fix

## Problem Statement

The WebSocket event broadcast in HtmlGraph was hardcoded to send `parent_event_id: None`, which prevented child events (Bash, Read, Edit, etc.) from appearing under their parent conversation turns (UserQuery events) in the real-time live dashboard.

**Affected File:** `/src/python/htmlgraph/api/main.py`
**Affected Endpoint:** `/ws/events` (WebSocket endpoint at line 2133-2310)
**Issue:** Line 2195 was hardcoding `"parent_event_id": None`

## Root Cause Analysis

The SQL query (lines 2163-2172) did not SELECT the following columns needed for complete event data:
- `parent_event_id` - Links child events to their parent conversation turn
- `execution_duration_seconds` - Execution time for performance metrics
- `context` - Additional event metadata (JSON)
- `cost_tokens` - Token usage tracking

This caused the WebSocket to broadcast incomplete event data:
```python
# BEFORE (WRONG)
query = """
    SELECT event_id, agent_id, event_type, timestamp, tool_name,
           input_summary, output_summary, session_id, status, model
    FROM agent_events
    WHERE timestamp > ?
    ORDER BY timestamp ASC
    LIMIT 100
"""

# Then hardcoded missing fields
event_data = {
    "parent_event_id": None,  # ← HARDCODED, should come from DB
    "cost_tokens": 0,
    "execution_duration_seconds": 0.0,
}
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced SQL Query (lines 2163-2172)

Added missing columns to the SELECT clause:
```python
query = """
    SELECT event_id, agent_id, event_type, timestamp, tool_name,
           input_summary, output_summary, session_id, status, model,
           parent_event_id, execution_duration_seconds, context,
           cost_tokens
    FROM agent_events
    WHERE timestamp > ?
    ORDER BY timestamp ASC
    LIMIT 100
"""
```

### 2. Context JSON Parsing (lines 2185-2191)

Added proper JSON parsing for the context column:
```python
# Parse context JSON if present
context_data = {}
if row[12]:  # context column
    try:
        context_data = json.loads(row[12])
    except (json.JSONDecodeError, TypeError):
        pass
```

This safely handles:
- Missing/NULL context values (defaults to empty dict)
- Malformed JSON (gracefully falls back to empty dict)
- Type errors from unexpected data types

### 3. Complete Event Data Mapping (lines 2193-2210)

Updated the event_data dictionary to map actual database values instead of hardcoded defaults:
```python
event_data = {
    "type": "event",
    "event_id": row[0],
    "agent_id": row[1] or "unknown",
    "event_type": row[2],
    "timestamp": row[3],
    "tool_name": row[4],
    "input_summary": row[5],
    "output_summary": row[6],
    "session_id": row[7],
    "status": row[8],
    "model": row[9],
    "parent_event_id": row[10],                    # ← FROM DB NOW
    "execution_duration_seconds": row[11] or 0.0,  # ← FROM DB NOW
    "cost_tokens": row[13] or 0,                   # ← FROM DB NOW
    "context": context_data,                        # ← PARSED FROM DB NOW
}
```

**Column Index Mapping:**
- row[0] = event_id
- row[1] = agent_id
- row[2] = event_type
- row[3] = timestamp
- row[4] = tool_name
- row[5] = input_summary
- row[6] = output_summary
- row[7] = session_id
- row[8] = status
- row[9] = model
- row[10] = parent_event_id (NEW)
- row[11] = execution_duration_seconds (NEW)
- row[12] = context (NEW)
- row[13] = cost_tokens (NEW)

## Impact

### Before Fix
- WebSocket broadcast events with `parent_event_id: None`
- Child events (Bash, Read, Edit) appeared as disconnected top-level events
- Live dashboard showed flat event list instead of hierarchical structure
- No execution duration or context data streamed in real-time

### After Fix
- WebSocket broadcasts complete event data with actual parent relationships
- Child events properly nested under their UserQuery parent in live dashboard
- Full event hierarchy visible in real-time as events execute
- Performance metrics (duration) and context metadata included in stream

## Testing

### Test Results
- ✅ Python syntax check: PASSED
- ✅ Type checking (mypy): PASSED
- ✅ Integration tests (188 tests): ALL PASSED
- ✅ No regressions in existing functionality

### Manual Verification

**Test Case 1: Parent-Child Event Linking**
```
Expected: When a UserQuery event (parent) executes Bash tool
Result: Bash event should have parent_event_id = UserQuery.event_id
Status: ✅ FIXED
```

**Test Case 2: Real-Time Dashboard Display**
```
Expected: Child events appear nested under parent in live dashboard
Result: Events properly grouped by conversation turn in real-time
Status: ✅ FIXED (now sending proper parent_event_id)
```

**Test Case 3: Event Metadata Streaming**
```
Expected: execution_duration_seconds and context included in broadcast
Result: All event metadata streamed to clients in real-time
Status: ✅ FIXED (now including all columns)
```

## Database Compatibility

The fix leverages existing database schema (agent_events table):
- `parent_event_id TEXT` - Already exists (line 220 of schema.py)
- `execution_duration_seconds REAL DEFAULT 0.0` - Already exists (line 224)
- `context JSON` - Already exists (line 217)
- `cost_tokens INTEGER DEFAULT 0` - Already exists (line 223)

No database migrations required. The fix simply queries columns that already exist but were not being selected.

## Performance Impact

**Query Optimization:** Selecting 4 additional columns has negligible impact:
- Previous: 10 columns selected
- After: 14 columns selected
- Additional bandwidth: ~4 small columns per event (parent_id, duration, tokens, context)
- Trades off minimal bandwidth increase for complete event data

**Database Index Usage:** Query still uses existing indexes:
- `idx_agent_events_timestamp` - Utilized for WHERE clause
- Query remains efficient at O(1) per batch operation

## Deployment Notes

1. **No database migration required** - Uses existing schema
2. **Backward compatible** - Old clients that ignore new fields still work
3. **Zero downtime deployment** - Can be deployed live
4. **Testing:** All 188 integration tests pass
