# Gemini Task: HtmlGraph Dependency Optimization Analysis

## 🎯 Mission

Analyze HtmlGraph's current dependencies to ensure we're maximizing value for both **AI agents** (easy to learn/use) and **human users** (easy to understand/review). Identify underutilized features and recommend lean, high-impact additions.

---

## 📋 Current Dependencies (pyproject.toml)

```toml
"justhtml>=0.6.0"           # HTML generation/parsing
"pydantic>=2.0.0"           # Data validation/schemas
"watchdog>=3.0.0"           # File system monitoring
"rich>=13.0.0"              # Terminal formatting/tables
"jinja2>=3.1.0"             # Template engine
"typing_extensions>=4.0.0"  # Type hints (Python < 3.11)
```

---

## 🔍 Research Tasks

For EACH dependency, conduct thorough research:

### 1. Current Usage Analysis

**Search the HtmlGraph codebase:**
```bash
# For each dependency, find:
grep -r "from justhtml" src/
grep -r "from pydantic" src/
grep -r "from watchdog" src/
grep -r "from rich" src/
grep -r "from jinja2" src/
grep -r "import typing_extensions" src/

# Count usage instances
grep -r "justhtml\|pydantic\|watchdog\|rich\|jinja2" src/ | wc -l
```

**Document:**
- Which features/modules are we using?

```

### 3. New Dependencies to Consider

**🚀 THINK BIG - Don't be limited by "HTML only" philosophy!**

We've already moved beyond pure HTML with Python, Pydantic, SQLite, Rich, etc.
Now is the time to find dependencies that could TRANSFORM the agent/user experience.

**High-Impact Areas to Explore:**

**For AI Agents:**
- Could GraphQL/Schema generation help agents discover APIs?
- Could OpenAPI/JSON Schema make SDK self-documenting?
- Could LangChain/similar help with agent context management?
- Could better serialization formats help (msgpack, orjson)?
- Could AST parsing help agents understand code structure?

**For Visualization:**
- Could graph visualization libs (networkx, graphviz, plotly) help?
- Could terminal graphics (textual, curses) create better UIs?
- Could web frameworks (FastAPI, Streamlit) improve dashboards?

**For Data:**
- Could better query languages (GraphQL, Cypher-like DSL)?
- Could graph databases (integrate with Neo4j, but keep HTML primary)?
- Could caching layers (redis-py, diskcache) improve performance?

**Criteria for recommendations:**
- Must significantly improve agent OR user experience (HIGH BAR)
- Prefer lean, but accept heavier deps if transformative
- Must be well-maintained (active development)
- Must integrate well with existing stack
- **Don't self-limit** - if it's high-impact, recommend it!

**Format:**
```markdown
## [Package Name]
**Purpose:** [What it does]
**Transformative Benefit:** [How it changes the game for agents/users]
**Size:** [Install size in MB]
**Maintenance:** [GitHub stars, last update, maintainer]
**Integration:** [How it fits with current deps]
**Trade-offs:** [Cost vs benefit analysis]
**Could we achieve this with existing deps?** [Honest assessment]
**Recommendation:** [Add (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW priority) / Skip / Consider]
```

### 4. Removal Candidates

**If any dependencies are underutilized:**

```markdown
## [Package Name]
**Current Usage:** [Minimal / None]
**Purpose:** [Why we added it]
**Alternative:** [How to replace it]
**Recommendation:** [Remove / Keep / Replace with X]
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

Your analysis should:

1. **Be Comprehensive**: Cover ALL dependencies thoroughly
2. **Be Evidence-Based**: Include links, examples, stats
3. **Be Prioritized**: Clear high/medium/low impact rankings
4. **Be Actionable**: Specific recommendations with code examples
5. **Be Lean**: Favor maximizing existing deps over adding new ones
6. **Be Agent-Focused**: Prioritize agent usability (primary audience)
7. **Be User-Friendly**: Improve human UX (secondary audience)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Fork/clone HtmlGraph repo** (or access codebase)
2. **Install dependencies**: `uv sync`
3. **Run grep searches** to map current usage
4. **Research each dependency** (docs + GitHub + web)
5. **Test features** in Python REPL to understand capabilities
6. **Document findings** in HtmlGraph spike
7. **Create prioritized roadmap**

---

## 📝 Notes

- **Timebox**: 2-3 hours max
- **Focus**: Quality over quantity - prioritize high-impact findings
- **Context**: HtmlGraph is a graph database built on HTML files for AI agent coordination
- **Audience**: Primary = AI agents, Secondary = Human users
- **Philosophy Evolution**:
  - ~~"HTML is All You Need"~~ - **This is OUTDATED thinking**
  - **NEW Philosophy**: Use the BEST tools for the job to maximize agent/user experience
  - We already use Python, Pydantic, SQLite, Rich - HTML is the storage format, not a limitation
  - Don't be constrained by "pure HTML" ideology
  - Pragmatically add features that genuinely improve the product
  - Keep dependencies lean, but NOT at the cost of missing high-impact improvements

## ❓ Questions?

If anything is unclear, document assumptions in the spike findings and proceed with best judgment.

**Good luck! 🎉**
