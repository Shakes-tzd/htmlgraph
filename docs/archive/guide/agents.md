## Agent Workflow

### 1. Session Start

When an agent begins working:

```bash
# Check current status
htmlgraph status
```

### 2. Create or Select Feature

```bash
# Create a new feature
htmlgraph feature create "Add user profile page" --priority high

# Start working on it
htmlgraph feature start feat-a1b2c3d4
```

### 3. Work and Track Progress

```bash
# Document decisions as spikes
htmlgraph spike create "Chose React Router over Reach Router (better TypeScript support)"
```

### 4. Complete Feature

```bash
# Mark feature as done
htmlgraph feature complete feat-a1b2c3d4
```

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

Multiple agents can work together on the same graph:

### Agent Assignment

Agents claim features by starting them:

```bash
# Agent claims a feature
htmlgraph feature start feature-001
```

### Handoff Notes

When passing work between agents, document the handoff as a spike:

```bash
# Agent 1 documents phase 1 completion
htmlgraph spike create "OAuth setup complete. OAuth provider configured, redirect endpoints created. Blocked on Database schema (feature-005). Next: JWT signing once DB ready, add token refresh logic."

# Agent 2 checks status before picking up
htmlgraph feature show feature-001
htmlgraph snapshot --summary
```

## CLI Integration Patterns

### Simple Task

```bash
htmlgraph feature create "Quick task" --priority medium
htmlgraph feature start feat-a1b2c3d4
# Do work...
htmlgraph feature complete feat-a1b2c3d4
```

### Complex Multi-Step Work

```bash
# Create a track for multi-phase work
htmlgraph track new "Complex Agent Task" --priority high
# Note track ID (e.g. trk-a1b2c3d4)

# Create features per phase
htmlgraph feature create "Phase 1: Setup" --priority high --track trk-a1b2c3d4
htmlgraph feature create "Phase 2: Implementation" --priority high --track trk-a1b2c3d4

# Work through each feature
htmlgraph feature start feat-phase1-id
# ... do work ...
htmlgraph feature complete feat-phase1-id

htmlgraph feature start feat-phase2-id
# ... do work ...
htmlgraph feature complete feat-phase2-id
```

## Hooks

HtmlGraph uses hooks to automatically track agent activity.

### Available Hooks

- **SessionStart**: Creates session, provides context
- **PostToolUse**: Logs every tool call
- **UserPromptSubmit**: Logs user queries
- **SessionEnd**: Finalizes session, generates summary

### Hook Configuration

**Claude Code:**

Hooks are configured automatically via the Claude Code plugin. The plugin bundles a `hooks.json` that registers all event handlers. Hook scripts live in `packages/claude-plugin/hooks/scripts/` in the plugin source. Install the plugin to activate all hooks:

```bash
claude plugin install htmlgraph
```

### Custom Hooks

Hooks are configured in `packages/claude-plugin/hooks/scripts/`. They run automatically via the plugin and use the `htmlgraph` CLI for tracking operations.

## Best Practices

### 1. Feature Creation Decision Framework

Use this framework to decide when to create a feature:

**Create a feature if:**

- Estimated >30 minutes of work
- Involves 3+ files
- Requires new tests
- Affects multiple components
- Hard to revert (schema changes, API changes)
- Needs documentation

**Implement directly if:**

- Single file, obvious change
- <30 minutes work
- No cross-system impact
- Easy to revert
- No tests needed

### 2. Use Tracks for Complex Work

For multi-feature projects, create a track first:

```bash
htmlgraph track new "Multi-phase project" --priority high
# Create features linked to the track
htmlgraph feature create "Phase 1" --priority high --track trk-a1b2c3d4
htmlgraph feature create "Phase 2" --priority high --track trk-a1b2c3d4
```

### 3. Document Decisions

Always record important decisions:

```bash
htmlgraph spike create "Chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB: better transactions, team familiarity"
```

### 4. One Feature at a Time

Focus on single features for clear attribution:

```bash
htmlgraph feature start feature-001
# Complete all work
htmlgraph feature complete feature-001
```
