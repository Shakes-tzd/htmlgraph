## 🔧 Additional Fixes Applied

During testing, 3 critical issues were discovered and fixed:

### Fix #1: MyPy Type Error in subagent_detection.py:104
**Issue:** `Returning Any from function declared to return "dict[str, Any]"`
**Fix:** Added explicit typing to intermediate variable
**Result:** ✅ Type checking now passes

### Fix #2: MyPy Type Error in pretooluse.py:563
**Issue:** Incompatible callable signature for run_in_executor
**Fix:** Wrapped session_id in lambda function
**Result:** ✅ Type checking now passes

### Fix #3: Git Branch Classification
**Issue:** `git branch` classified as write instead of read
**Fix:** Enhanced classification with flag-aware logic
**Result:** ✅ All 20 git tests now pass

## 📋 Failing Tests Analysis

**All 80 failures** are due to **pre-existing CLI module refactoring** incompleteness:

### Import Errors (18 failures)
```python
# Missing command exports:
cmd_cigs_summary              # 4 failures
cmd_cigs_patterns             # 5 failures
cmd_cigs_reset_violations     # 4 failures
cmd_orchestrator_acknowledge  # 2 failures
cmd_cigs_status               # 1 failure
```

### Format Issues (2 failures)
```python
test_cli_json_output_format              # 1 failure
test_cli_sdk_both_use_operations         # 1 failure
```

### Integration Tests (60 failures)
- Cascading from CLI import failures
- Not related to orchestration bugs #1-4

**Important:** These failures do NOT affect the orchestration bug fixes themselves. They are a separate concern from CLI module architecture.

## 🚀 Deployment Status

### Current State
✅ **Code Quality:** Perfect (linting + type checking pass)
✅ **Core Functionality:** 100% (all 4 bugs working)
✅ **Unit Tests:** 100% (orchestrator tests pass)
⚠️ **Integration Tests:** 96.8% (80 CLI-related failures)

### Deployment Recommendation

**NOT READY YET** - Fix CLI issues first:

```bash
# Current blocker: 80 failing tests (code-hygiene rules require 100%)

# To deploy:
1. Fix missing CLI command exports
2. Get all 2913 tests to pass
3. Run: ./scripts/deploy-all.sh 0.26.6 --no-confirm
```

### Why Not Deploy Now?
- Project rules mandate **all tests pass before deployment**
- Deployment script will block on failures (as designed in CLAUDE.md)
- Even though orchestration bugs are fixed, CLI failures prevent deployment
- This is correct behavior - maintain code quality standards
