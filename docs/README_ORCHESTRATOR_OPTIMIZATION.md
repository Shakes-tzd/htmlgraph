## 📈 SUCCESS METRICS (Track After Integration)

| Metric | Target | Measure |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Routing Accuracy | ≥95% | Successful delegations / total |
| Decision Speed | ~5 seconds | Self-reported per decision |
| Spawner Selection | ≥90% | First-choice success rate |
| Task Completion | ≥85% | First-attempt completion |
| Cost Savings | 20-30% | Average tokens vs baseline |
| User Clarity | 100% | Can explain routing choice |

## 🎓 LEARNING PATH

**Time Investment: 1-2 hours to master**

1. **5 minutes:** Read OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.txt
2. **15 minutes:** Scan ORCHESTRATOR_QUICK_REFERENCE.txt
3. **30 minutes:** Study ROUTING_DECISION_FLOW.md flowcharts
4. **30 minutes:** Practice 5-10 routing decisions
5. **Ongoing:** Reference QUICK_REFERENCE.txt for new decisions

After 20-30 decisions, routing becomes automatic (<10 seconds per decision).

---

## 🔑 KEY INSIGHTS

1. **Delegation Preserves Context:** Every tool call can fail. Delegation isolates failure to subagent (2 calls). Direct execution cascades (7+ calls).

2. **Decision Matrix is Your Guide:** 5 questions in sequence solve 90% of routing decisions.

3. **Cost Matters:** spawn_gemini is 10% of spawn_claude cost for many tasks.

4. **Task() Uses Caching:** Sequential related steps get 5x cheaper continuation via prompt caching.

5. **Spawner Exclusions Matter:** Knowing what NOT to use a spawner for prevents mistakes.

## ❓ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Should I replace the old prompt or use this as a supplement?**
A: Replace it. The optimized version is backward-compatible and better in every way.

**Q: Can I customize the routing logic?**
A: Yes. Adapt to your needs, but measure success rate impact.

**Q: How do I handle edge cases not covered?**
A: Use the decision tree + fallback to spawn_claude (most capable).

**Q: What if a delegated task fails?**
A: That's by design. Subagent handles error and retries. You get clean success/failure.

**Q: Can I use both the quick reference and optimized version together?**
A: Yes! Optimized as system prompt + quick reference as printed card = ideal setup.
