# Configurable Delegation Enforcement Thresholds - Implementation Summary

**Bug Fixed:** bug-41daad16 - Hardcoded thresholds were too aggressive and lacked flexibility

## Problem Statement

The orchestrator delegation enforcement had hardcoded thresholds that were too aggressive:
- **3-call exploration threshold** - Triggered warnings too quickly during legitimate research
- **3-violation circuit breaker** - Too strict, blocked users after minor mistakes
- **No time-based decay** - Violations accumulated indefinitely across long sessions
- **No rapid sequence handling** - Exploratory "trial and error" counted as multiple violations

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Configuration Infrastructure

**Created:** `src/python/htmlgraph/orchestrator_config.py`

Provides complete configuration management with:
- **Pydantic models** for type-safe config (ThresholdsConfig, AntiPatternsConfig, ModesConfig)
- **YAML file loading** from multiple locations (project-specific and user defaults)
- **Time-based decay** - Violations expire after configurable time window
- **Rapid sequence collapsing** - Multiple violations within time window count as one
- **Get/set helpers** for dot-notation config access (e.g., `thresholds.exploration_calls`)

**Key Functions:**
- `load_orchestrator_config()` - Load from file or return defaults
- `save_orchestrator_config()` - Persist to YAML
- `filter_recent_violations()` - Apply time-based decay
- `collapse_rapid_sequences()` - Collapse rapid errors
- `get_effective_violation_count()` - Calculate actual count after decay/collapsing

### 2. Default Configuration

**Created:** `.htmlgraph/orchestrator-config.yaml`

**Increased thresholds (more permissive):**
```yaml
thresholds:
  exploration_calls: 5          # Increased from 3
  circuit_breaker_violations: 5 # Increased from 3
  violation_decay_seconds: 120  # NEW - 2 minute decay
  rapid_sequence_window: 10     # NEW - 10 second debounce

anti_patterns:
  consecutive_bash: 5   # Increased from 4
  consecutive_edit: 4   # Increased from 3
  consecutive_grep: 4   # Increased from 3
  consecutive_read: 5   # Increased from 4
```

### 3. Integration with Orchestrator Mode

**Modified:** `src/python/htmlgraph/orchestrator_mode.py`

- Added `violation_history: list[dict]` field to track full violation timeline
- Updated `increment_violation()` to use time-based decay and collapsing
- Modified `get_violation_count()` to return effective count after decay
- Circuit breaker now uses configurable threshold

**Key Changes:**
```python
# Before: Hardcoded threshold
if mode.violations >= 3:
    mode.circuit_breaker_triggered = True

# After: Configurable threshold with decay
config = load_orchestrator_config()
effective_count = get_effective_violation_count(mode.violation_history, config)
if effective_count >= config.thresholds.circuit_breaker_violations:
    mode.circuit_breaker_triggered = True
```

### 4. Updated Enforcement Logic

**Modified:** `src/python/htmlgraph/hooks/orchestrator.py`

- Load config dynamically in `is_allowed_orchestrator_operation()`
- Use `config.thresholds.exploration_calls` for exploration detection
- Display current threshold in violation messages (e.g., "3/5 violations")
- Added config adjustment hint in circuit breaker message

**Modified:** `src/python/htmlgraph/hooks/validator.py`

- Converted hardcoded `ANTI_PATTERNS` dict to `get_anti_patterns()` function
- Dynamically generates patterns from config
- Maintains backward compatibility with legacy constant

### 5. CLI Commands

**Modified:** `src/python/htmlgraph/cli/work/orchestration.py`

Added three new commands:

```bash
# Show current configuration
uv run htmlgraph orchestrator config-show

# Set a threshold value
uv run htmlgraph orchestrator config-set thresholds.exploration_calls 7

# Reset to defaults
uv run htmlgraph orchestrator config-reset
```

**Implemented Classes:**
- `OrchestratorConfigShowCommand` - Display config with formatting
- `OrchestratorConfigSetCommand` - Update specific values
- `OrchestratorConfigResetCommand` - Restore defaults

### 6. Documentation Updates

**Modified:** `src/python/htmlgraph/orchestrator-system-prompt-optimized.txt`

Added new section explaining:
- Default threshold values
- How to view/modify configuration
- Time-based decay behavior
- Rapid sequence collapsing

### 7. Comprehensive Tests

**Created:** `tests/test_orchestrator_config.py`

**19 tests covering:**
- ✅ Default configuration values
- ✅ Load/save from YAML files
- ✅ Get/set config values by path
- ✅ Time-based violation filtering
- ✅ Timestamp format handling (ISO string, float)
- ✅ Rapid sequence collapsing
- ✅ Effective violation count calculation
- ✅ Anti-pattern generation from config
- ✅ Config display formatting
- ✅ Edge cases (boundary conditions, invalid timestamps)
- ✅ Pydantic model serialization

**All tests pass:** 19/19 ✅

## Benefits

### 1. Reduced False Positives
- Higher thresholds (5 vs 3) allow more legitimate exploration
- Reduces frustration during research/debugging sessions

### 2. Time-Based Forgiveness
- Old violations expire after 2 minutes (configurable)
- Long-running sessions don't accumulate stale violations
- Users get a "clean slate" after pausing work

### 3. Rapid Error Tolerance
- Multiple quick mistakes within 10 seconds count as one
- Prevents "violation spam" during trial-and-error exploration
- More forgiving of natural workflow patterns

### 4. Project-Specific Tuning
- Teams can adjust thresholds per project
- Strict enforcement for production, relaxed for research projects
- Configuration lives in `.htmlgraph/` (version controlled)

### 5. User-Level Defaults
- Personal defaults in `~/.config/htmlgraph/orchestrator-config.yaml`
- Applied to all projects without project-specific config
- Easy to customize personal workflow preferences

## Usage Examples

### View Current Configuration
```bash
$ uv run htmlgraph orchestrator config-show

HtmlGraph Orchestrator Configuration
==================================================

Thresholds:
  exploration_calls: 5
  circuit_breaker_violations: 5
  violation_decay_seconds: 120
  rapid_sequence_window: 10

Anti-patterns:
  consecutive_bash: 5
  consecutive_edit: 4
  consecutive_grep: 4
  consecutive_read: 5
```

### Adjust Thresholds
```bash
# Be more strict (lower threshold)
$ uv run htmlgraph orchestrator config-set thresholds.exploration_calls 3

# Be more lenient (higher threshold)
$ uv run htmlgraph orchestrator config-set thresholds.circuit_breaker_violations 8

# Increase decay window (violations last longer)
$ uv run htmlgraph orchestrator config-set thresholds.violation_decay_seconds 300
```

### Reset to Defaults
```bash
$ uv run htmlgraph orchestrator config-reset

Configuration reset to defaults
Config file: .htmlgraph/orchestrator-config.yaml
Exploration calls: 5
Circuit breaker: 5
Violation decay: 120s
```

## Technical Details

### Configuration Priority
1. Project-specific: `.htmlgraph/orchestrator-config.yaml`
2. User defaults: `~/.config/htmlgraph/orchestrator-config.yaml`
3. Built-in defaults: Hardcoded in `OrchestratorConfig` class

### Time-Based Decay Algorithm
```python
def filter_recent_violations(violations, decay_seconds):
    cutoff = now - timedelta(seconds=decay_seconds)
    return [v for v in violations if v.timestamp > cutoff]
```

### Rapid Sequence Collapsing
```python
def collapse_rapid_sequences(violations, window_seconds):
    collapsed = [violations[0]]
    for v in violations[1:]:
        if (v.timestamp - collapsed[-1].timestamp) > window_seconds:
            collapsed.append(v)
    return collapsed
```

### Effective Violation Count
```python
def get_effective_violation_count(violations, config):
    # 1. Filter old violations (decay)
    recent = filter_recent_violations(violations, config.decay_seconds)

    # 2. Collapse rapid sequences
    collapsed = collapse_rapid_sequences(recent, config.window_seconds)

    # 3. Return count
    return len(collapsed)
```

## Future Enhancements

Possible future improvements:
1. **Per-tool thresholds** - Different limits for Read vs Edit vs Grep
2. **Adaptive thresholds** - Learn from session patterns
3. **Context-aware decay** - Faster decay during exploration, slower during implementation
4. **Team presets** - Shared configuration templates for teams
5. **Web UI** - Visual config editor in dashboard

## Conclusion

The configurable thresholds implementation successfully addresses the original bug (bug-41daad16) by:
- ✅ Replacing hardcoded values with configuration
- ✅ Increasing default thresholds to reduce false positives
- ✅ Adding time-based decay to prevent stale violations
- ✅ Implementing rapid sequence collapsing for trial-and-error workflows
- ✅ Providing CLI commands for easy adjustment
- ✅ Maintaining backward compatibility
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (19 tests)

The system is now more flexible, forgiving, and tunable to different workflow styles and project requirements.
