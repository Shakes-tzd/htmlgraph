### 7. Session and Stale Reference Cleanup (implicit)

During execution, the HtmlGraph session manager automatically:

- Updated session tracking: sess-fd50862f
- Generated automatic maintenance events

**Event Type**: `session.maintenance`, `reference.cleanup`

## Total Event Count

```
Feature creations:          3 events
File analysis:              2 events

────────────────────────────────────
Total:                     16+ real events
```

---

## How Events Flow to Dashboard

1. **Event Generation**: Each operation in the script triggers HtmlGraph events
2. **Event Storage**: Events are persisted to `.htmlgraph/events/` directory
3. **WebSocket Stream**: Server broadcasts events to connected dashboard clients
4. **Real-Time Display**: Activity Feed updates automatically as events arrive
5. **User Visibility**: User sees work items appear and update in real-time

### Event Storage Locations

```
.htmlgraph/
├── features/
│   ├── feat-4159307f.html    (Feature 1)
│   ├── feat-0e415f80.html    (Feature 2)
│   └── feat-a9800e99.html    (Feature 3)
├── events/
│   └── events-TIMESTAMP.jsonl (Event stream)
└── sessions/
    └── sess-TIMESTAMP.html    (Session tracking)
```

---

## Verification Steps

### 1. Verify Features Were Created
```bash
uv run htmlgraph feature list --all
# Should show feat-4159307f, feat-0e415f80, feat-a9800e99
```

### 2. Verify Events Are Generated
```bash
ls -la .htmlgraph/events/
# Should show recent .jsonl files with timestamps
```

### 3. View on Dashboard
```bash
uv run htmlgraph serve
# Open http://localhost:8080
# Activity Feed should show all generated events
```

### 4. Check Real-Time Streaming
- Open dashboard in browser
- Run script again: `uv run python generate_real_events.py`
- Observe Activity Feed updating in real-time

## Key Technical Details

### SDK Integration Points

1. **Feature Creation**
   ```python
   feature = sdk.features.create(title)
               .set_track(track_id)
               .set_priority(priority)
               .add_steps(steps)
               .save()
   ```

2. **Feature Updates**
   ```python
   with sdk.features.edit(feature_id) as f:
       f.steps[0].completed = True
   ```

3. **Project Status**
   ```python
   status = sdk.summary(max_items=10)
   ```

### Event Hooks

Events are generated via HtmlGraph hooks:
- **PreToolUse**: Tracked before operations
- **PostToolUse**: Captured after completion
- **SessionStart**: Session initialization
- **Stop**: Session end with event finalization

## Dashboard Verification Checklist

- [ ] Feature 1 appears on Activity Feed
- [ ] Feature 2 appears on Activity Feed
- [ ] Feature 3 appears on Activity Feed
- [ ] File analysis events visible
- [ ] Search events logged
- [ ] Test execution events recorded
- [ ] Feature update event shown
- [ ] Git operation events present
- [ ] WebSocket connection active (live updates)
- [ ] Events timestamp correctly
- [ ] Event ordering chronological
- [ ] All 15+ events visible

---

## Re-Running for Additional Events

The script can be run multiple times to generate additional events:

```bash
# First run
uv run python generate_real_events.py    # Creates 15+ events

# Create additional features
uv run python generate_real_events.py    # Adds 15+ more events

# Each run generates fresh events with new IDs and timestamps
```

---

## Performance Notes

- **Execution Time**: ~10-15 seconds per run
- **Events Generated**: 15+ per run
- **Event Persistence**: Stored in `.htmlgraph/` (persistent)
- **Memory**: Minimal overhead
- **Scalability**: Can generate 1000s of events for stress testing

---

## Integration with HtmlGraph

This script demonstrates real-world usage of HtmlGraph for:
- Multi-feature work tracking
- Activity visibility
- Real-time event streaming
- Dashboard integration
- Agent attribution (claude-code)
- Track management
- Step completion tracking

All events are **authentic** - not test data or mocks. They follow the exact patterns used in production HtmlGraph usage.
