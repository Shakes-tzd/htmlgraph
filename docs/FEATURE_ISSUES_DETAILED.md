## Root Cause Summary

### Root Cause #1: Missing SDK Usage (64 untracked features)
- Features created without calling SDK.features.create()
- No data-agent-assigned attribute captured
- Pre-dates agent attribution feature implementation
- Affects 71.9% of all features

### Root Cause #2: No Status/Step Validation (14 status mismatches)
- No enforcement that status matches step completion
- Features marked 'done' without checking steps
- No hook to sync status when steps complete
- Affects 15.7% of all features

### Root Cause #3: Abandoned Backlog (33 features)
- Features created but never started
- No regular triage/prioritization process
- No agent assignment to ownership
- Affects 37.1% of all features

### Root Cause #4: Incomplete Work Tracking (18 features)
- Work completed but feature created without agent context
- SDK not invoked with agent parameter
- Retroactive feature creation loses attribution
- Affects 20.2% of all features
