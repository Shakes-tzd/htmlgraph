# HtmlGraph 0.7.1 Release Notes

**Released**: December 23, 2025
**Type**: Minor Release (Feature Addition + Bug Fixes)
**Package**: https://pypi.org/project/htmlgraph/0.7.1/

---

## 🎯 What's New

### Memory File Synchronization Tool

A new CLI command to maintain documentation consistency across AI platforms:

```bash
# Check if files are synchronized
htmlgraph sync-docs --check

# Generate platform-specific file
htmlgraph sync-docs --generate gemini
htmlgraph sync-docs --generate claude

# Synchronize all files (default)
htmlgraph sync-docs
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Validates that platform files (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, etc.) reference central AGENTS.md
- ✅ Supports custom platform templates
- ✅ Generates platform-specific files with consistent structure
- ✅ Single source of truth for AI agent documentation

**Why This Matters:**
- Eliminates documentation drift across platforms
- Makes maintenance easier (update once in AGENTS.md)
- Ensures all AI agents have access to complete documentation

---

## 🚀 Deployment Script Enhancements

The `deploy-all.sh` script now supports flexible deployment modes:

```bash
# Documentation changes only (commit + push)
./scripts/deploy-all.sh --docs-only

# Full release (all 7 steps)
./scripts/deploy-all.sh 0.7.1

# Build package only (test builds)
./scripts/deploy-all.sh --build-only

# Skip PyPI publishing (build + install only)
./scripts/deploy-all.sh 0.7.1 --skip-pypi

# Preview what would happen (dry-run)
./scripts/deploy-all.sh --dry-run

# Skip plugin updates
./scripts/deploy-all.sh 0.7.1 --skip-plugins
```

**New Flags:**
- `--docs-only` - Only commit and push to git (skip build/publish)
- `--build-only` - Only build package (skip git/publish/install)
- `--skip-pypi` - Skip PyPI publishing step
- `--skip-plugins` - Skip plugin update steps
- `--dry-run` - Show what would happen without executing

**7 Deployment Steps:**
1. Git Push - Push commits and tags to origin/main
2. Build Package - Create wheel and source distributions
3. Publish to PyPI - Upload package to PyPI
4. Local Install - Install latest version locally
5. Update Claude Plugin - Run `claude plugin update htmlgraph`
6. Update Gemini Extension - Update version in gemini-extension.json
7. Update Codex Skill - Check for Codex and update if present

## 📚 Documentation Improvements

### Centralized AI Agent Documentation

All AI agent documentation is now centralized in `AGENTS.md`:
- Python SDK quick start and API reference
- Deployment instructions with flexible script usage
- Memory file synchronization workflow
- Best practices for AI agents
- Complete workflow examples

### Platform-Specific Enhancements

**CLAUDE.md:**
- Added deployment script documentation with all flags
- Added memory file sync tool usage
- Added dogfooding context explaining dual purpose
- Clarified general workflows vs project-specific

**GEMINI.md:**
- Added deployment script documentation
- Added memory file sync tool usage
- Updated with imperative language (DO THIS, NEVER, MUST)
- Proper cross-references to AGENTS.md

### Imperative Documentation Style

All platform documentation now uses imperative language:
- ✅ "DO THIS" instead of "you can do this"
- ✅ "NEVER" instead of "you should avoid"
- ✅ "REQUIRED" instead of "it's recommended"
- ✅ Clear commands and actionable instructions

## 🐛 Bug Fixes & Improvements

### Removed Non-Functional Git Hooks

**Problem:** Git hooks were causing issues without providing value:
- File locking conflicts (errno 35) preventing event logging
- Pre-commit hook not executable, showing warnings on every commit
- Zero git events actually logged despite 21+ failures
- Duplicating functionality already provided by `git log`

**Solution:** Removed all git hooks:
- Deleted all hook symlinks from `.git/hooks/`
- Deleted all hook scripts from `.htmlgraph/hooks/`
- Deleted error log file with 21+ failures
- **Result:** No more annoying warnings on every commit!

**Why This Improves Things:**
- ✅ Cleaner commit experience (no warnings)
- ✅ Faster commits (no background hook failures)
- ✅ Simpler codebase (225 lines deleted)
- ✅ Git already provides commit tracking via `git log`

### SDK CRUD Operations

Completed SDK with delete operations:
- `sdk.features.delete(feature_id)` - Delete a feature
- `sdk.bugs.delete(bug_id)` - Delete a bug
- `sdk.chores.delete(chore_id)` - Delete a chore
- Full CRUD support for all collections

## 🎓 Examples

### Memory File Sync Workflow

```bash
# 1. Check current state
htmlgraph sync-docs --check

# Output:
# ✅ AGENTS.md exists
# ✅ root:GEMINI.md references AGENTS.md
# ✅ root:CLAUDE.md references AGENTS.md
# ✅ All files are properly synchronized!

# 2. Generate a new platform file
htmlgraph sync-docs --generate codex

# 3. Force overwrite existing file
htmlgraph sync-docs --generate gemini --force
```

### Flexible Deployment

```bash
# Quick doc update workflow
./scripts/deploy-all.sh --docs-only

# Test build without publishing
./scripts/deploy-all.sh --build-only

# Preview release without execution
./scripts/deploy-all.sh 0.7.2 --dry-run

# Full release
./scripts/deploy-all.sh 0.7.2
```

### SDK Delete Operations

```python
from htmlgraph import SDK

sdk = SDK(agent="claude")

# Delete a completed feature
sdk.features.delete("feature-old-123")

# Delete multiple bugs
for bug_id in ["bug-001", "bug-002", "bug-003"]:
    sdk.bugs.delete(bug_id)

# Delete a chore
sdk.chores.delete("chore-cleanup")
```
