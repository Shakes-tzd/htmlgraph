## Language Transformation

### Permissive → Imperative

**Before**:
- "should use" (permissive)
- "can delegate" (optional)
- "prefer" (suggestion)
- "consider using" (optional)

**After**:
- "MUST use" (imperative)
- "ALWAYS use" (imperative)
- "REQUIRED" (imperative)
- "NEVER use Task() for..." (imperative)

**Metrics**:
- 48 imperative statements
- 39 HeadlessSpawner references
- 32 cost-awareness mentions

## Cost Impact Analysis

### Individual Operation Savings

| Operation Type | Before (Task) | After (Spawner) | Savings |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| Exploration    | $15-25        | FREE            | 100%    |
| Code Gen       | $10           | $3              | 70%     |
| Git Ops        | $5            | $2              | 60%     |

### Workflow Example: Implement Authentication

**Before** (all Task()):
- Research: $20
- Implement: $10
- Tests: $10
- Commit: $5
- **TOTAL: $45**

**After** (cost-first delegation):
- Research (Gemini): FREE
- Implement (Codex): $3
- Tests (Codex): $3
- Commit (Copilot): $2
- **TOTAL: $8 (82% savings)**

### Scale Impact: 100 Operations

**Typical Distribution**:
- 40 exploration tasks
- 30 code implementations
- 30 git operations

**Before**: 40×$20 + 30×$10 + 30×$5 = $1,250
**After**: 40×$0 + 30×$3 + 30×$2 = $150

**Total savings: $1,100 (88% reduction)**

## Visual Markers

Added ✅/❌ markers throughout:
- ✅ = CORRECT / DO THIS
- ❌ = INCORRECT / DON'T DO THIS

**Count**: ~50 visual markers added for clarity

## Code Examples

### Total Code Blocks
- **Before**: ~10 Task() examples only
- **After**: ~20 examples (HeadlessSpawner + Task() comparison)

### Example Pattern (repeated throughout)
```python
# ✅ CORRECT - Use HeadlessSpawner
result = spawner.spawn_gemini(...)

# ❌ INCORRECT - Don't use Task()
Task(prompt="...", subagent_type="...")
```

## Decision Tree Priority Shift

### Before (Generic)
1. Will this be one tool call?
2. Does this require error handling?
3. Could this cascade?
4. Strategic vs tactical?

### After (Cost-First)
1. Is this exploration? → Gemini (FREE)
2. Is this code? → Codex (70% cheaper)
3. Is this git? → Copilot (60% cheaper)
4. Strategic coordination? → Task (Opus/Sonnet)
5. Trivial single call? → Direct execution

## "Why Delegation Matters" Priority Shift

### Before (4 reasons)
1. Context Preservation
2. Parallel Efficiency
3. Error Isolation
4. Cognitive Clarity

### After (5 reasons, new #1)
1. **Cost Optimization** (NEW - MOST IMPORTANT)
2. Context Preservation
3. Parallel Efficiency
4. Error Isolation
5. Cognitive Clarity

## Reflection System Updates

### Before (4 questions)
- Could this have been delegated to a subagent?
- Would parallel Task() calls have been faster?
- Is a work item tracking this?
- What if this fails?

### After (5 questions, cost-focused)
- Could this have been delegated to Gemini (FREE)?
- Could this have been delegated to Codex (70% cheaper)?
- Could this have been delegated to Copilot (60% cheaper)?
- What if this operation fails?
- Would parallel HeadlessSpawner calls have been faster?

## SDK Integration Changes

### Before
```python
# Generic Task() delegation
Task(prompt=explorer["prompt"], subagent_type=explorer["subagent_type"])
```

### After
```python
# Cost-optimized multi-AI delegation
from htmlgraph.orchestration import HeadlessSpawner
spawner = HeadlessSpawner()

research_result = spawner.spawn_gemini(...)  # FREE
code_result = spawner.spawn_codex(...)       # 70% cheaper
git_result = spawner.spawn_copilot(...)      # 60% cheaper
```

## Expected Behavior Changes

### Agent Decision-Making

**Before** (Task-first):
1. Agent sees any task
2. Defaults to Task() delegation
3. No cost consideration
4. Subagent type varies but uses Claude

**After** (Cost-first):
1. Agent sees exploration task
2. Checks decision tree: "Is this exploration?"
3. Uses spawn_gemini() (FREE)
4. Cost-aware by default

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Analyze Codebase
**Before**: Task($20, explorer)
**After**: spawn_gemini(FREE)

#### Scenario 2: Implement Feature
**Before**: Task($10, general-purpose)
**After**: spawn_codex($3)

#### Scenario 3: Commit Changes
**Before**: Task($5, general-purpose)
**After**: spawn_copilot($2)
