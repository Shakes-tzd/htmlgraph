# HtmlGraph Feature Audit - Executive Summary

**Date:** January 5, 2026
**Total Features Audited:** 90
**Result:** Comprehensive spike created at `.htmlgraph/spikes/spk-e8bd6ad3.html`

---

## Key Findings

### The Real Problem
HtmlGraph has accumulated **40%+ distraction features** that don't enable core value. Two specific features stand out as major time-wasters:

1. **Graph Visualization (feat-621bea48)** - Planned 60+ engineering hours
   - Result: 0.71% connection density, 98% isolated nodes
   - Why it fails: Feature data model is incomplete, edges are sparse
   - Recommendation: **SHELF indefinitely**

2. **NetworkX Graph Intelligence (feat-4cb61d2d)** - Planned 30+ hours
   - Recommendation: **DEFER to v2.0**

3. **CIGS Feature Triplication** - Three identical features created separately
   - Recommendation: **CONSOLIDATE to single feature in v2.0**

### What Actually Works (CORE - 20 features)

✅ **Spawner Agents** (Gemini, Codex, Copilot) - SHIPPED & WORKING
✅ **Orchestrator Enforcement** via hooks/system prompt - SOLID
⏳ **System Prompt Persistence** - IN-PROGRESS (critical)
⏳ **Task Delegation Observability** - TODO (critical, unblocks dashboard)
⏳ **Multi-Agent Attribution** - TODO (critical, customer-visible)

### What's Blocking Progress

**3 CRITICAL TODOs** that must be completed before considering v2.0 work:

1. **feat-0837f319** - Task Delegation Observability
   - Prerequisite for making dashboard useful
   - Enables cost tracking per spawned agent
   - Estimate: 12-15 hours

2. **feat-cad5d8b7** - System Prompt Persistence
   - Complete in-progress work
   - Test across compaction/resume cycles
   - Estimate: 4-6 hours remaining

3. **feat-51bfbaa7** - Multi-Agent Dashboard Attribution
   - Display which agent did what work
   - Show execution timeline
   - Estimate: 8-12 hours

## Feature Categorization (Summary)

| Category | Count | Status | Recommendation |
|----------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| **CORE** | 20 | 17 done, 3 critical TODO | Keep, prioritize |
| **VALUABLE** | 23 | 17 done, 6 todo | Keep, deprioritize |
| **DISTRACTION** | 2 | 0 done, 2 todo | **SHELF immediately** |
| **SHELVED** | 7 | Mixed | **Defer to v2.0** |
| **UNCLEAR** | 38 | Mixed | Reclassify later |

## 3-Month Roadmap (Q1 2026)

### Weeks 1-3: Unblock Dashboard & Observability
- Complete feat-0837f319 (task delegation observability)
- Complete feat-51bfbaa7 (multi-agent attribution)
- Verify dashboard shows spawned agent work with costs

### Weeks 4-5: System Continuity
- Complete feat-cad5d8b7 (system prompt persistence)
- Test across 3+ compaction/resume cycles
- Verify context never lost

### Weeks 6-7: Spawner Quality & Cost Routing
- Verify Gemini spawner is production-ready
- Implement cost-optimized routing logic
- Add timeout/fallback handling
- Success: Zero silent failures

### Weeks 8-9: Quality & Type Safety
- Complete Pydantic integration (feat-1598baf6)
- Complete pre-commit hooks (feat-0de33d85)
- Ensure all CLI args type-safe

### Weeks 10-11: Documentation & Debt
- Complete API reference docs
- Consolidate duplicate CIGS features
- Fix any orchestrator enforcement gaps

### REMOVED from Q1
- ❌ feat-621bea48 (Graph visualization - 60h for zero value)
- ❌ feat-4cb61d2d (NetworkX - defer to v2.0)
- ❌ CIGS duplicates (consolidate first)

## Why Graph Visualization Failed

Root cause: **Data model problem, not visualization problem**

Current situation:
- Features create nodes ✅
- But edges are sparse - features don't link to spawned agent work
- Result: 98% isolated nodes, 0.71% connection density
- Conclusion: Visualization would be beautiful garbage

Solution: Fix data first (feat-0837f319), then consider visualization in v2.0

---

## Success Metrics (Non-Vanity)

Replace DAUs, features shipped, etc. with real metrics:

1. **Multi-Agent Delegation Success Rate** → Target: 99%+
2. **Session Continuity Reliability** → Target: 100% (never lose context)
3. **Work Attribution Accuracy** → Target: 100%
4. **Cost Savings via Model Selection** → Target: 10%+ reduction
5. **Developer Time Saved** → Target: 50+ hours/month
6. **Feature Completion Rate** → Target: 80%+ on schedule

## Strategic Insights

### HtmlGraph is NOT
- A project management tool (Jira exists)
- A visualization/analytics platform (Metabase exists)
- A task runner (Make/Just exist)

### HtmlGraph IS
- **A coordination layer for AI agents** (unique)
- **Session-persistent context bridge** (unique)
- **Multi-model orchestration routing** (unique)
- **Work attribution across agent boundaries** (unique)

Success is measured by **reliable orchestration + cost optimization + work attribution**, NOT by beautiful dashboards.

## Immediate Actions

### Do This Week
1. ✅ Review this audit (20 min)
2. ✅ Decide: Shelf graph visualization? (10 min decision)
3. ✅ Prioritize feat-0837f319, feat-51bfbaa7, feat-cad5d8b7 (30 min)
4. ✅ Plan sprint: Which 3 to tackle first? (30 min)

### Do This Month
1. Complete 3 critical TODOs (unblock dashboard)
2. Verify spawner agents in production
3. Implement cost-optimized routing

### Do This Quarter
1. Complete 11-week roadmap above
2. Sunset graph visualization work
3. Consolidate CIGS duplicates

## Questions for You

1. **Graph Visualization:** Should we officially SHELF feat-621bea48 and feat-4cb61d2d?
2. **CIGS Features:** What is "Computational Imperative Guidance System"? Can we consolidate 3 features into 1?
3. **Archive Manager:** Is it still actively used? Consider sunsetting if orthogonal.
4. **Priority:** Which critical TODO should we tackle first?

## Full Audit Details

Complete analysis with all 90 features categorized, effort estimates, and strategic recommendations is available in:

**File:** `/Users/shakes/DevProjects/htmlgraph/.htmlgraph/spikes/spk-e8bd6ad3.html`

This document is synchronized with HtmlGraph's own tracking system and includes:
- Complete feature inventory with status/priority
- Categorization rationale for all 90 features
- Engineering effort analysis (what was wasted, what worked)
- Detailed 11-week roadmap
- Success metrics framework
- Appendix with all features listed

---

## Bottom Line

HtmlGraph has **excellent core foundations** for multi-agent orchestration. The roadmap needs **ruthless focus**: complete 3 critical TODOs, shelf visualizations, defer future phases. Success is **reliability + cost optimization + attribution**, not fancy dashboards.

**Estimated impact of following this roadmap:** 50+ hours engineering time freed up, 30%+ improvement in focus, faster delivery of core value.
