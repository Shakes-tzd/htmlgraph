## Changes Made

### 1. Merged parallel-orchestrator into htmlgraph-tracker
- **New name**: "HtmlGraph Workflow Skill"
- **Location**: 
- **Auto-activation**: Still works (session start hook)

### 2. Added Orchestrator Directives Section
- **Position**: Core Responsibility #1 (before "Use SDK, Not MCP Tools")
- **Content**:
  - Delegation philosophy (context preservation)
  - Operations to delegate vs execute directly
  - Decision framework (4 questions)
  - Task ID pattern for parallel coordination
  - Reference to 

### 3. Added Parallel Workflow Subsection
- **Position**: Under Orchestrator Directives
- **Content**:
  - 6-phase process (ANALYZE, PREPARE, DISPATCH, MONITOR, AGGREGATE, VALIDATE)
  - Quick start code example with SDK methods
  - When to parallelize vs not
  - Anti-patterns to avoid

### 4. Updated Skill Metadata
- **Description**: Now includes "orchestration" and "parallel coordination"
- **Trigger keywords**: Added orchestrator, parallel, concurrent, delegation, Task tool, multi-agent, spawn agents
- **Title**: "HtmlGraph Workflow Skill" (was "HtmlGraph Tracker Skill")

### 5. Archived Old Skill
- **Location**: 
- **README**: Explains consolidation and migration path
- **Status**: No action needed for users (seamless)

## Files Modified

1.  - Merged content, updated metadata
2.  - Created archive documentation
3.  - Moved from old location

## Testing

- [x] Verified skill still auto-activates
- [x] Checked orchestrator directives are clear and actionable
- [x] Confirmed no duplicate content between sections
- [x] References to external docs are accurate ()
- [x] Old parallel-orchestrator skill is archived (not deleted)
- [x] Git commit successful
- [x] Pre-commit checks passed (ruff, mypy)

## Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: One skill for all HtmlGraph workflow patterns
2. **Auto-Enforcement**: Orchestrator mode now auto-activates with tracking
3. **Clearer Mental Model**: Orchestration is part of workflow, not separate
4. **No Confusion**: Users don't have to choose between two skills
5. **Complete Coverage**: Tracking + orchestration + delegation + parallel coordination

## Quality Checks

- ✅ Merged skill auto-activates at session start
- ✅ Orchestrator directives are clear and actionable
- ✅ No duplicate content between sections
- ✅ References to external docs are accurate
- ✅ Old parallel-orchestrator skill is archived (not deleted)
- ✅ All pre-commit checks passed

## Next Steps

- [ ] Optional: Add PreToolUse blocking hook for orchestrator enforcement (separate task)
- [ ] Optional: Update CLAUDE.md to reference unified skill (if needed)
- [ ] Monitor: Watch for any issues with auto-activation or trigger keywords
