```

### CATEGORY 2: STALE FEATURES (Not Modified >7 Days)
**Status:** NONE - All features are actively maintained

---

### CATEGORY 3: TEST/DUPLICATE FEATURES (8 TOTAL - 53% OF WIP!)
**Status:** CRITICAL - Recommend immediate cleanup

These appear to be leftover from delegation testing and should be removed:

1. **Delegation Test Feature 1 (2 instances)**
   - feat-273f174b (high priority, 0/3 steps)
   - feat-58cfd77c (high priority, 0/3 steps)

2. **Delegation Test Feature 2 (2 instances)**
   - feat-6415af33 (medium priority, 0/4 steps)
   - feat-8c4655a5 (medium priority, 0/4 steps)

3. **Delegation Test Feature 3 (2 instances)**
   - feat-12ffea6b (low priority, 0/2 steps)
   - feat-1d6ccb7f (low priority, 0/2 steps)

4. **Test Delegation Event Tracking (2 instances)**
   - feat-930c96ba (medium priority, 0/5 steps)
   - feat-a89d158d (medium priority, 0/5 steps)

**Likely Reason:** These were created during orchestrator/delegation testing and never cleaned up.

---

### CATEGORY 4: CRITICAL PRIORITY FEATURES
**Status:** NONE - No critical features in in-progress status

All critical work appears to be either done or in "todo" status, which is reasonable.

---

### CATEGORY 5: BLOCKED FEATURES (No Progress Started)
**Status:** 13 of 15 features (87%) have 0 completed steps

Only **feat-4159307f** has any progress (1/5 steps = 20%).

**Real Features (Non-Test) Blocked:**
- feat-0cf9dec1: Dashboard Activity Feed Real-Time Streaming (0/5)
- feat-2e458b68: Orchestration Feature 1 (0/3)
- feat-2f17d60a: Orchestration Feature 3 (0/3)
- feat-3a580c9b: Orchestration Feature 2 (0/3)
- feat-66599a45: Dashboard Activity Feed Real-Time Streaming (0/5)
- feat-cad5d8b7: System Prompt Persistence Across Sessions (0/0 - no steps defined!)

---

## Real vs Test Features Analysis

### Real Features (7 total - 47% of WIP)

**Dashboard/Real-Time (3 instances - may be actual duplicates, not test artifacts)**
- feat-0cf9dec1: Dashboard Activity Feed Real-Time Streaming
- feat-4159307f: Dashboard Activity Feed Real-Time Streaming (only one with progress)
- feat-66599a45: Dashboard Activity Feed Real-Time Streaming

**Orchestration Features (3 instances - different feature, no duplicates)**
- feat-2e458b68: Orchestration Feature 1
- feat-2f17d60a: Orchestration Feature 3
- feat-3a580c9b: Orchestration Feature 2

**System Prompt**
- feat-cad5d8b7: System Prompt Persistence Across Sessions (NO STEPS DEFINED)

---

## Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: 8 Test/Delegation Features Still In-Progress
**Severity:** HIGH
**Action:** Remove these features immediately:
- feat-273f174b, feat-58cfd77c (Delegation Test 1)
- feat-6415af33, feat-8c4655a5 (Delegation Test 2)
- feat-12ffea6b, feat-1d6ccb7f (Delegation Test 3)
- feat-930c96ba, feat-a89d158d (Test Delegation Event Tracking)

**Impact:** These clutter the WIP backlog and reduce signal-to-noise ratio.

### Issue 2: 3 Duplicate Dashboard Features
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Status:** Unclear if these are real duplicates or test artifacts
**Action:** Investigate whether feat-0cf9dec1 and feat-66599a45 are duplicates of feat-4159307f (the only one with progress)

### Issue 3: System Prompt Feature Has Zero Steps
**Severity:** LOW
**Status:** feat-cad5d8b7 has 0/0 steps - needs step definition
**Action:** Either define implementation steps or move to "done" if complete

### Issue 4: 87% of Features Blocked (No Progress)
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Status:** Only 1 of 15 features has started implementation
**Action:** 
- Investigate blockers on real features
- Prioritize Dashboard real-time streaming work
- Clarify Orchestration features requirements

---

## Recommendations

### PRIORITY 1: Remove Test Features (20 mins)
Remove from in-progress status immediately:
\`\`\`bash
# Delete these feature files
rm .htmlgraph/features/feat-273f174b.html
rm .htmlgraph/features/feat-58cfd77c.html
rm .htmlgraph/features/feat-6415af33.html
rm .htmlgraph/features/feat-8c4655a5.html
rm .htmlgraph/features/feat-12ffea6b.html
rm .htmlgraph/features/feat-1d6ccb7f.html
rm .htmlgraph/features/feat-930c96ba.html
rm .htmlgraph/features/feat-a89d158d.html
\`\`\`

**After cleanup:** 7 real features remain (Dashboard, Orchestration, System Prompt)

### PRIORITY 2: Consolidate Dashboard Features (10 mins)
Investigate whether feat-0cf9dec1 and feat-66599a45 are duplicates:
- If YES: Remove them, keep feat-4159307f (the one with progress)
- If NO: Clarify their distinct purposes and update titles

### PRIORITY 3: Define System Prompt Steps (5 mins)
feat-cad5d8b7 needs either:
- Implementation steps defined (if still in progress)
- Status moved to "done" (if already complete)

### PRIORITY 4: Unblock Real Features (TBD)
For remaining real features:
1. feat-0cf9dec1/feat-4159307f/feat-66599a45: Dashboard Real-Time Streaming
   - Identify blocker preventing progress
   - Complete remaining 4 steps

2. feat-2e458b68, feat-2f17d60a, feat-3a580c9b: Orchestration Features
   - Clarify requirements
   - Start implementation

---

## Metrics After Cleanup

**Current State:**
- Total In-Progress: 15
- Test/Duplicate: 8 (53%)
- Real Features: 7 (47%)

**Expected State (After Cleanup):**
- Total In-Progress: ~4-5
- Real Features: Dashboard + Orchestration + System Prompt
- Test/Duplicate: 0 (0%)
- Signal-to-Noise Ratio: 100% real work

---

## Summary

The HtmlGraph project has **healthy development activity** (all features modified in last 48 hours), but the WIP backlog is **cluttered with test artifacts** (53% test/duplicate features). A 25-minute cleanup would reduce WIP to 7 real features and significantly improve backlog clarity.

**Key Finding:** Most real work is currently blocked at 0% progress, with only 1 feature (20% complete). Recommend investigating blockers after cleanup.
