## Current State Analysis

**Current CLAUDE.md (v0.23.0):**
- 89 lines (down from 788)
- ✅ Has: Project vision, orchestrator mode reference, code quality, deployment, quick commands, dogfooding, skills reference, rules reference
- ✅ Uses progressive disclosure: Points to skills for detailed workflows
- ✅ Concise and optimized

**Before CLAUDE.md (pre-v0.23.0):**
- 788 lines
- Had: Full project architecture, HTML spec, API design, implementation phases, detailed workflows
- Mixed general patterns with project-specific content

## Key Differences

**Removed in optimization:**
1. Full architecture documentation (HTML spec, API design) - CORRECT to remove
2. Implementation phases/roadmap - CORRECT to remove (now in issues/features)
3. Detailed orchestrator directives - CORRECT to remove (now in skill)
4. Detailed debugging workflow - CORRECT to remove (now in skill)
5. Project vision details - PARTIALLY removed (may need some restoration)

**What current CLAUDE.md has:**
1. ✅ Quick reference to AGENTS.md and GEMINI.md
2. ✅ Brief project vision
3. ✅ Orchestrator mode reference (delegates to skill)
4. ✅ Code quality commands (delegates to skill)
5. ✅ Deployment commands (delegates to skill)
6. ✅ Quick commands table
7. ✅ Dogfooding mention
8. ✅ Skills reference table
9. ✅ Rules reference list

## Analysis: Does Current CLAUDE.md Need Changes?

**Actually, the current CLAUDE.md looks GOOD!** Let me verify:

1. **Project-specific content present?**
   - ✅ Code quality: Has command, references `/code-quality` skill
   - ✅ Deployment: Has command, references `/deployment-automation` skill
   - ✅ Quick commands: Full table present
   - ✅ Dogfooding: Mentioned briefly
   - ✅ Rules: All 5 rules files referenced

2. **Progressive disclosure working?**
   - ✅ CLAUDE.md = Quick reference
   - ✅ Skills = Detailed workflows
   - ✅ Rules files = Complete documentation

3. **Missing anything critical?**
   - 🤔 Debugging workflow: Not mentioned in main sections
   - 🤔 Memory sync workflow: Not mentioned
   - 🤔 Clarity section: No "Project vs General" distinction

## Conclusion

The current CLAUDE.md is **mostly correct**, but could benefit from:
1. Adding debugging workflow section (reference to skill)
2. Adding memory sync section (reference to skill) 
3. Adding clarity section explaining project-specific vs general patterns
