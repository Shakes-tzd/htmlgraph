            <h3>Investigation Summary</h3>
            <p>Investigated high-drift activity patterns that emerged during feature-self-tracking work. Activities included repeated skill activations, glob queries, and file operations that were classified as having 0.71 drift score.</p>

            <h4>Activities Investigated:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Skill: htmlgraph-tracker activation (multiple instances)</li>
                <li>Glob: Pattern matching for bugs and chores directories</li>
                <li>Read: drift-queue.json inspection</li>
                <li>Write: Work item file creation</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Findings:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Self-referential drift:</strong> Activities related to HtmlGraph's own tooling were flagged as drift when they're actually core to feature-self-tracking</li>
                <li><strong>False positives:</strong> Drift detection treats tool invocations (Skill, Glob, Read, Write) as divergent from code implementation work</li>
                <li><strong>Feature scope clarity:</strong> feature-self-tracking is meta-work (tracking HtmlGraph development itself), which naturally involves infrastructure tooling</li>
                <li><strong>Classification patterns:</strong> High-drift activities were exploring the drift system itself - investigating the investigator</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Recommendations:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Update feature-self-tracking's drift keywords to include: "drift", "queue", "classifier", "tracker", "htmlgraph"</li>
                <li>Add file patterns: ".htmlgraph/drift-*", ".htmlgraph/*/*.html" to expected scope</li>
                <li>Consider that meta-tracking work naturally has different drift signatures than feature implementation</li>
                <li>Document that investigating drift is a valid activity under feature-self-tracking</li>
            </ul>
