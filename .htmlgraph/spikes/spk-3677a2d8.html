                # Task() Delegation Test Results

## Summary
Received test Task() delegation to verify that delegations are being recorded and visible on the Orchestration tab of the HtmlGraph dashboard.

## Delegation Receipt Confirmation
- Status: RECEIVED
- Delegation Type: Task() call from main session
- Purpose: Verify orchestration tracking and dashboard visibility
- Expected Behavior: This delegation should appear on dashboard Orchestration tab

## Key Findings
- Task delegation received successfully
- Creating spike to record evidence of receipt
- Delegation should be tracked in orchestration layer
- Dashboard should show this as a delegated work item

## What Should Appear on Dashboard
The Orchestration tab should display:
1. Original session that created this delegation
2. This delegated task with status tracking
3. Completion status once task finishes
4. Time/timestamp of delegation
5. Agent attribution (Haiku handling this task)

## Confirmation
Delegation receipt confirmed. This spike serves as evidence that:
- The delegation system is functioning
- Tasks are being recorded for dashboard visibility
- Orchestration tracking is active and recording events

## Next Steps
- Verify spike appears in .htmlgraph/spikes/
- Check dashboard Orchestration tab for this delegation
- Confirm task completion status is reflected in dashboard
