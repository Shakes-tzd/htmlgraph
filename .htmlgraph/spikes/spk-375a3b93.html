                ## Issue
Activity Feed dashboard was showing events in ascending order (oldest first) 
instead of descending order (newest first). This was backwards from the expected UX.

## Root Cause
The `/ws/events` WebSocket endpoint in src/python/htmlgraph/api/main.py (line 554) 
was using `ORDER BY timestamp ASC` when it should use `ORDER BY timestamp DESC`.

## Solution
Changed the WebSocket endpoint query from:
- `query += " ORDER BY timestamp ASC LIMIT 100"`

To:
- `query += " ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 100"`

Other endpoints were already correct:
- `/views/activity-feed` (line 208): Already using DESC
- `/api/events` (line 300): Already using DESC
- `/views/orchestration` (line 337): Already using DESC

## Verification
- All quality checks passed: ruff, mypy, pytest
- 1354 tests passed (pre-existing failures unrelated to this change)
- Code committed and pre-commit hooks verified
- File: src/python/htmlgraph/api/main.py
- Commit: 5eabba3

## Impact
Events in the real-time WebSocket stream now display newest first, 
providing the expected chronological display pattern for user observability.
