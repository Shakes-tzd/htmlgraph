            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>
                Multiple high-drift activities detected (drift score 0.71) related to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Reading drift-queue.json repeatedly</li>
                    <li>Reading feature-self-tracking.html</li>
                    <li>Activating htmlgraph-tracker skill multiple times</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Root cause investigation needed:</strong> Why are these activities classified as high-drift?
                Are they actually off-topic for the feature, or is the classification algorithm too aggressive?
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Is 0.71 the correct threshold for high drift?</li>
                <li>Should skill invocations in response to system hooks count as drift?</li>
                <li>Should reading feature context files be excluded from drift calculation?</li>
                <li>How does the classifier distinguish between on-task research and genuine drift?</li>

        <!-- Context -->
        <section data-context>
            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>
                These activities occurred during the system's initial setup phase when:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Session hooks were being tested</li>
                <li>htmlgraph-tracker skill was being activated for session continuity</li>
                <li>Drift detection system was reading its own queue for classification</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                It's unclear if these self-referential activities should be flagged as drift at all.
