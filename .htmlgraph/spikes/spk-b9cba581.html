                ## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Critical Problem**: 82.2% of features (74/90) and 99.4% of spikes (629/630) are NOT linked to tracks.

**Current State**:
- 90 total features, only 16 have track_id (17.8% coverage)
- 630 total spikes, only 4 have track_id (0.6% coverage)  
- 19 total tracks defined
- Track linkage completely optional, unenforced
- No mechanism to assign features at creation time
- No bulk assignment UI for 704 unlinked items

**Impact**:
- Planning decisions made on 17.8% of actual work
- Multi-agent coordination invisible
- Strategic planning impossible without manual tracking

---

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

1. **Design Assumption**: Tracks treated as optional organizational layer
2. **SDK Evolution Gap**: Track linkage added AFTER feature system existed
3. **Validation Gap**: No constraint in data model (track_id accepts null)
4. **Missing CLI/UI**: No user-facing track selection during creation
5. **No Error Handling**: Creating feature without track succeeds silently

---

## PROPOSED SOLUTION: 3-PHASE ARCHITECTURE

### PHASE 1: Immediate (1-2 days) - Prevent NEW Untracked Items

SDK Changes:
- Add set_track(track_id) method to BaseBuilder
- Add track_id validation in save() method
- Raise ValueError with helpful error if track missing

CLI Changes:
- Add --track flag to 'htmlgraph feature create'
- Interactive track selection if not specified
- Auto-select if only 1 track exists

Backward Compatibility: 1-week warning phase

### PHASE 2: Short-term (3-5 days) - Fix 704 Existing Items

Bulk Assignment UI:
- Dashboard section: "Organize Unlinked Items"
- Interactive grid with search/filter
- Bulk select and assign to track
- Progress bar + completion report

CLI Command:
- htmlgraph bulk-assign --track trk-xxx --dry-run
- htmlgraph bulk-assign --track trk-xxx

### PHASE 3: Long-term (1-2 weeks) - Intelligent Auto-Assignment

Track Suggester:
- Analyze feature title + description
- Match keywords to track titles
- Suggest most likely track

Track-Based Planning:
- Query features by track
- View track progress
- Dashboard track organization view

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

Before:
- Untracked items: 700 (82% features, 99% spikes)
- Track-based planning coverage: 17.8%

After PHASE 1:
- New untracked items: 0 (prevented)
- Coverage: 100% for new features

After PHASE 2:
- Total untracked: 0 (all 700 fixed)
- Track-based planning coverage: 100%

After PHASE 3:
- Auto-assignment with intelligent suggestions
- Track-based work planning fully operational

---

## EFFORT ESTIMATION

PHASE 1: 1-2 days, 8-12h
PHASE 2: 3-5 days, 16-24h
PHASE 3: 1-2 weeks, 24-32h
Testing/Docs: 3-5 days, 12-24h
TOTAL: 2-4 weeks, 60-92h

## FILES TO CREATE/MODIFY

New Files:
- src/python/htmlgraph/operations/bulk_assignment.py
- src/python/htmlgraph/cli_commands/bulk_assign.py
- tests/python/test_feature_track_linkage.py

Modified Files:
- src/python/htmlgraph/builders/base.py
- src/python/htmlgraph/builders/feature.py
- src/python/htmlgraph/cli_commands/feature.py
- src/python/htmlgraph/sdk.py
- src/python/htmlgraph/dashboard.html

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. Review design with team
2. Approve 3-phase implementation sequence
3. Start PHASE 1 this week (highest priority)
4. Execute PHASE 2 bulk assignment
5. Plan PHASE 3 for next sprint
