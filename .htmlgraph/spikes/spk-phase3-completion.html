## What Has Been Prepared (Not Executed)

### Test Infrastructure
- ✅ Fixtures created: `tests/unit/api/conftest.py`
- ✅ Repository tests template: `tests/unit/api/test_repositories.py`
- ✅ Service tests template: `tests/unit/api/test_services.py`
- ⏳ **NOT YET RUN** - Tests are ready but not executed

### Test Coverage Targets (Defined)

## Phase 3 Acceptance Criteria (6 Defined, 0 Verified)

| # | Criterion | Target | Status |
|---|-----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Code Organization | main.py <500 lines | Not tested |
| 2 | API Backward Compatibility | 100% response shape match | Not tested |
| 3 | Database Architecture | 100% FastSQLA usage | Not tested |
| 4 | Caching Strategy | >80% hit rate | Not tested |
| 5 | Query Performance | 25%+ improvement | Not tested |
| 6 | WebSocket Performance | <30ms latency | Not tested |

**Status**: ❌ **0/6 verified**

---

## Current Test Execution Status

### Test Suite State
- **Total Tests**: 2127 selected (3 deselected)
- **Status**: Tests are available, ready to run
- **Sample Run Results**:
  - Tests starting to run but long-running
  - Many tests SKIPPED (likely browser-based tests)
  - Some tests PASSING but incomplete run

### What This Means
- Tests exist and are runnable
- Test framework is working
- But full suite has not completed execution to collect final results
- Dashboard is working correctly (files present, accessible)

---

## What Needs to Happen for Phase 3 Completion

### Phase 3a: Unit Tests (2-3 days)
```bash
# Run unit tests
uv run pytest tests/unit/api/ -v

# Expected: All 43 unit tests passing
# Expected coverage: 85%+
```

### Phase 3b: Integration Tests (2-3 days)
```bash
# Run integration tests
uv run pytest tests/integration/api/ -v

# Expected: All integration tests passing
# Expected backward compatibility verified
```

### Phase 3c: Manual Testing (2-3 days)
- Dashboard UI verification
- Performance measurement
- WebSocket testing
- Query analysis

### Phase 3d: Code Quality (1 day)
```bash
# Full quality gate
uv run pytest && uv run mypy src/ && uv run ruff check src/

# Expected: 0 errors, 0 warnings
```

### Phase 3e: Documentation & Release (1 day)
- Results summary
- Performance improvement verification
- Deployment checklist
- QA sign-off

---

## v0.29.0 Deployment Status

### Pre-Deployment Requirements (Not Yet Met)
- [ ] Phase 3 execution complete
- [ ] All acceptance criteria verified (0/6 currently)
- [ ] All tests passing (unknown - full run incomplete)

2. ⏳ Phase 3 execution complete (PENDING)
3. ⏳ All 6 acceptance criteria verified (PENDING)
4. ⏳ v0.29.0 deployment to PyPI (PENDING)

---

## Dashboard Status

### File Status
- ✅ `src/python/htmlgraph/dashboard.html` - Present
- ✅ `index.html` - Synced
- ✅ Dashboard is accessible and working

### Expected Performance Improvements
(To be verified in Phase 3c)
- Activity feed: 200ms → <150ms (-25%)
- Agent stats: 150ms → <120ms (-20%)
- Orchestration: 250ms → <180ms (-28%)
- WebSocket: 50ms → <30ms (-40%)

---

## Timeline Assessment

### Actual vs Planned
```
Planned Preparation: Complete ✅
Planned Execution Start: 2026-02-04
Current Execution Status: Not yet started ⏳
Planned Completion: ~2026-02-10
```

### Path Forward
1. **Start Phase 3a** (Unit tests) - IMMEDIATE
2. **Run test suite** - Full execution to collect results
3. **Verify acceptance criteria** - 6/6 must pass
4. **Deploy v0.29.0** - After all criteria verified
5. **Close Phase 3 spike** - Document all results
