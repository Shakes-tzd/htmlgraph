# HtmlGraph Orchestrator Configuration
# Controls delegation enforcement behavior

# Detection Thresholds
thresholds:
  # Exploration pattern detection
  # How many consecutive Grep/Read/Glob calls before warning
  exploration_calls: 5  # Increased from 3 to reduce false positives

  # Circuit breaker
  # How many violations before blocking all non-core operations
  circuit_breaker_violations: 5  # Increased from 3 to be less aggressive

  # Time-based decay
  # Violations older than this don't count toward circuit breaker
  violation_decay_seconds: 120  # 2 minutes - violations expire

  # Rapid sequence window
  # Commands within this window count as one violation
  rapid_sequence_window: 10  # 10 seconds - debounce rapid errors

# Anti-pattern Detection
anti_patterns:
  # How many consecutive calls of same tool before warning
  consecutive_bash: 5   # Increased from 4
  consecutive_edit: 4   # Increased from 3
  consecutive_grep: 4   # Increased from 3
  consecutive_read: 5   # Increased from 4

# Enforcement Modes
# These define behavior when violations occur
