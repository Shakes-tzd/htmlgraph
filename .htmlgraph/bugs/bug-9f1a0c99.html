## Issue
Feature Tracker - Smart Kanban page displays no tasks despite having created features.

## Problems Identified
1. All Kanban columns show "0" count and "No tasks"
   - TO DO column empty (should show planned/pending features)
   - IN PROGRESS column empty (should show in-progress features)
   - BLOCKED column empty (should show blocked features)
   - DONE column empty (should show completed features)

2. Recently created "HtmlGraph Development Roadmap" track (trk-28178b71) with 12 features isn't showing:
   - 6 completed features (Phase 1 & 2) should appear in DONE
   - 6 planned features (Phase 2.5 & 3) should appear in TO DO

## Expected Behavior
- DONE column shows 6 completed Phase 1 & 2 features
- TO DO column shows 6 planned Phase 2.5 & 3 features
- IN PROGRESS column empty or shows in-progress features
- Counts reflect actual feature numbers (not all "0")

## Actual Behavior
- All columns show empty with "No tasks"
- All counts show "0"
- Newly created features invisible in Kanban view
- UI loads correctly, but data layer not populated

## Potential Root Causes
1. Kanban view not querying the database correctly
2. Features from tracks not being loaded
3. Caching issue - features loaded before track was created
4. Database query doesn't include recently created features
5. Feature status not being properly indexed in database
6. Race condition between feature creation and Kanban query

## Impact
Users cannot see feature status overview, undermining the Kanban workflow.
Kanban is a core feature for work visualization - this blocks that usage entirely.

## Related Work Items
- Track: trk-28178b71 (HtmlGraph Development Roadmap)
- Location: src/python/htmlgraph/api/main.py (features view/kanban endpoint)

## Test Case
1. Create a new track with multiple features
2. Navigate to Feature Tracker - Smart Kanban
3. Verify columns show created features
4. Check database query returns features with proper status field
5. Verify caching layer includes recently created features
