        <!-- Problem Statement -->
        <section data-problem>
            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>
                When skill invocations (e.g., <code>Skill(htmlgraph:htmlgraph-tracker)</code>) are used
                during feature development work, they are flagged as high-drift activities (0.71) instead
                of being correctly attributed to the active feature context.
            </p>

            <h4>Observed Behavior:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiple skill invocations during feature-self-tracking work are marked as independent high-drift activities</li>
                <li>These activities are queued in drift-queue.json with 0.71 scores</li>
                <li>They are not automatically associated with the parent feature</li>
                <li>The drift detection treats tool overhead as a feature itself rather than a tool-use expense</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Expected Behavior:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Tool invocations (Skills, reads, searches) should be attributed to the active feature context</li>
                <li>Tool overhead shouldn't create independent high-drift work items</li>
                <li>Multiple consecutive tool invocations should be grouped as a single activity unit</li>
                <li>Drift score should reflect the work itself, not the tooling overhead</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Root Cause Analysis -->
        <section data-root-cause>
            <h3>Root Cause Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                The drift detection algorithm is treating skill invocations as top-level activities
                rather than as overhead of the parent activity. Specifically:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>When a feature is being worked on, tool calls (Skills, Reads, etc.) are being tracked as independent activities</li>
                <li>These tool calls have inherent drift due to tool invocation overhead</li>
                <li>The algorithm doesn't have a concept of "child activities" or "tool overhead"</li>
                <li>Result: tool overhead gets flagged as drift instead of being attributed to the feature</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <!-- Context -->
        <section data-content>
            <h3>Detailed Context</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>When:</strong> 2025-12-16T13:11:24 - 13:11:25 UTC<br>
                <strong>Feature Context:</strong> feature-self-tracking<br>
                <strong>Session:</strong> session tracking and drift analysis<br>
            </p>

            <h4>Activities Flagged:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><code>Skill: {'skill': 'htmlgraph:htmlgraph-tracker'}</code> [drift: 0.71]</li>
                <li><code>Read: /Users/shakes/DevProjects/htmlgraph/.htmlgraph/spikes/spike-repeated-skill-invocations.html</code> [drift: 0.71]</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Why This Is a Bug:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>These are not independent work items—they're tool calls made during feature development</li>
                <li>Tool overhead shouldn't accumulate as separate drift entries</li>
                <li>The feature context (feature-self-tracking) should account for the tool usage</li>
                <li>High drift scores on tool invocations confuse the work item classification system</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Impact:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Drift-queue.json fills with tool overhead instead of actual work divergence</li>
                <li>Auto-classification creates spurious spikes and bugs from tool usage</li>
                <li>Developers can't distinguish real drift from tooling overhead</li>
                <li>Self-tracking feature is less reliable for observability</li>
            </ul>
