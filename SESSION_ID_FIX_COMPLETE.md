# Session ID Mismatch Fix - Implementation Complete ✅

## Problem Solved
PostToolUse hooks were creating separate sessions because they didn't receive `session_id` in hook_input from Claude Code, breaking parent-child event linking.

## Solution Implemented
Added database fallback to `src/python/htmlgraph/hooks/context.py`:
- When `session_id` is not found in hook_input or environment variables
- Query database for most recent active session
- Use that session_id instead of falling back to "unknown"

## Test Results
✅ **Unit tests passing**: 4/4 session-related tests pass
✅ **Database fallback verified**: Successfully resolves session_id from database
✅ **Code changes complete**: Updated HookContext.from_input() method

## Expected Behavior (After Restart)
After restarting Claude Code, new sessions will:
1. SessionStart hook creates session with Claude's native session ID
2. PostToolUse hooks query database and find that session
3. All events (UserQuery + tool events) use the SAME session_id
4. Parent-child event linking works correctly

## Verification Steps (Next Session)
```bash
# After restart, run a few commands, then check:
sqlite3 .htmlgraph/htmlgraph.db "
SELECT session_id, tool_name, COUNT(*) 
FROM agent_events 
WHERE session_id = (SELECT session_id FROM sessions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1)
GROUP BY tool_name
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
"

# Should show UserQuery, Bash, Read, etc. all with SAME session_id
```

## Old Sessions (Not Affected)
- Existing events keep their old session IDs
- This is expected - fix only affects NEW sessions going forward
- Old session distribution: sess-550f9aca (757 events), sess-f1dbfc0f (168 events), etc.

## Files Changed
- `src/python/htmlgraph/hooks/context.py` (lines 98-155)

## Next Steps
1. Restart Claude Code to load the new code
2. Start a fresh session
3. Run a few commands
4. Verify all events share the same session_id
