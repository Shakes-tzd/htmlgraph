    **DO THIS:**

    1. **Run these commands to capture session info:**
       ```bash
       htmlgraph session list --limit 1
       htmlgraph session end
       ```

    2. **Parse the output** to extract:
       - Session ID
       - Session duration
       - Event count
       - Features worked on
       - Activity summary

    3. **Present the session summary** using the output template above

    4. **Include the summary of accomplishments:**
       - List features worked on during this session
       - Show any steps marked as complete
       - Acknowledge progress made

    5. **Provide next-session guidance:**
       - Mention how to view dashboard: `htmlgraph serve`
       - Suggest next steps for the next session
       - Link to session record in `.htmlgraph/sessions/`

    6. **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:**
       - ONLY run `/htmlgraph:end` when the user explicitly requests it
       - Do NOT automatically end sessions
       - Wait for explicit user command
