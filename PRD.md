# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# HtmlGraph: "HTML is All You Need"

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: December 16, 2024  
**Author**: Shakes  
**Status**: Draft

---

## Executive Summary

**HtmlGraph** is a lightweight graph database framework built entirely on web standards (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) that eliminates the need for external graph databases like Neo4j or Memgraph. It enables AI agents to coordinate work using HTML files as nodes, hyperlinks as edges, and CSS selectors as the query language.

**Market Opportunity**: With the explosion of AI coding agents (Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, Aider), developers need simple infrastructure for agent coordination and observability. Current solutions require Docker, complex databases, and custom protocols. HtmlGraph provides a zero-dependency alternative that's human-readable and version-control friendly.

**Target Launch**: Q1 2025

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

**For AI Agent Developers:**
1. **Infrastructure Complexity**
   - Need Docker for Neo4j/Memgraph
   - Learn Cypher query language
   - Manage database migrations
   - Handle connection pooling
   - Deploy and monitor database servers

2. **Poor Human Observability**
   - Database queries needed to see agent state
   - No visual representation without custom UI
   - Hard to debug agent behavior
   - Can't "view source" on agent decisions

3. **Version Control Issues**
   - Binary database dumps don't diff well
   - Can't see what changed in git
   - Hard to code review agent state
   - Difficult to rollback changes

4. **Integration Friction**
   - Each agent needs database drivers
   - Serialization/deserialization overhead
   - Network latency to database
   - Credential management

**For Human Operators:**
1. Can't easily see what agents are doing
2. Need specialized tools to query state
3. Hard to manually intervene or correct
4. No "open in browser and understand" option

### Market Validation

- **LangGraph** (3.5k GitHub stars) - Custom state management
- **AutoGPT** (167k stars) - JSON files for memory
- **Claude Code** - Proprietary coordination
- **Cursor/Windsurf** - Opaque agent state

All of these reinvent coordination mechanisms. None use web standards.

## Solution Overview

### Core Concept

**Use HTML as the graph database format:**
- HTML files = Graph nodes
- `<a href>` = Graph edges  
- `data-*` attributes = Node properties
- CSS selectors = Query language
- Web browsers = Human interface
- justhtml/DOMParser = Machine interface

### Key Innovation

**Dual Interface Design:**
```
                ┌─────────────────┐
                │   HTML Files    │
                │  (Source of     │
                │   Truth)        │
                └────────┬────────┘
                         │
           ┌─────────────┴──────────────┐
           │                            │
    ┌──────▼───────┐           ┌───────▼────────┐
    │   Browsers   │           │   AI Agents    │
    │   (Human     │           │   (Machine     │
    │    View)     │           │    View)       │
    └──────────────┘           └────────────────┘
         CSS                    Pydantic
       Rendering                Serialization
```

### Value Proposition

**For Developers:**
- ✅ Zero dependencies (no Docker, no database servers)
- ✅ Zero learning curve (everyone knows HTML/CSS)
- ✅ Zero deployment complexity (just files)
- ✅ Version control native (git diff works perfectly)

**For AI Agents:**
- ✅ Lightweight context (Pydantic serialization)
- ✅ Simple queries (CSS selectors)
- ✅ Fast reads (no network latency)
- ✅ Safe writes (file system guarantees)

**For Human Operators:**
- ✅ Visual observability (open in browser)
- ✅ Easy debugging (view source)
- ✅ Simple intervention (edit HTML)
- ✅ Searchable history (grep works)

Node(
    id: str,              # Unique identifier
    title: str,           # Human-readable title
    type: str,            # "feature", "task", "note", etc.
    status: str,          # "todo", "in-progress", "done", etc.

    updated: datetime,    # Last update timestamp
)
```

**Edge (Hyperlink):**
```html
<a href="target-node.html" 
   data-relationship="blocks"
   data-since="2024-12-16">
    Target Node Title
</a>
```

### API Surface

**Python:**
```python
# Graph operations
graph = HtmlGraph('directory/')
graph.add(node)
graph.update(node)
graph.query(css_selector)
graph.get(node_id)
graph.shortest_path(from_id, to_id)

# Agent interface
agent = AgentInterface('directory/')
task = agent.get_next_task()
context = agent.get_context(task_id)
agent.complete_step(task_id, step_index)
```

**JavaScript:**
```javascript
// Graph operations
const graph = new HtmlGraph();
await graph.loadFrom('directory/');
const nodes = graph.query(css_selector);
const path = graph.findPath(from, to);

// Dashboard

- **Impact**: High
- **Mitigation**: Add optional SQLite indexer for large graphs

**Risk 2: Concurrent Writes**
- **Issue**: Multiple agents writing to same file
- **Likelihood**: High
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Document as append-mostly pattern, add file locking

**Risk 3: Browser Memory**

- **Mitigation**: Implement pagination, virtual scrolling

### Market Risks

**Risk 4: "Not Serious Enough"**
- **Issue**: Developers may see HTML as toy solution
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact**: High
- **Mitigation**: Focus on simplicity as feature, not limitation

**Risk 5: Limited Adoption**
- **Issue**: Network effect of existing graph DBs
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact**: High
- **Mitigation**: Target niche (AI agents) where complexity is pain point

**Risk 6: Competition**
- **Issue**: Neo4j or others build similar solution
- **Likelihood**: Low
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Open source + community-driven development

### Execution Risks

**Risk 7: Scope Creep**
- **Issue**: Adding too many features before launch
- **Likelihood**: High
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Strict MVP scope, post-launch roadmap

**Risk 8: Documentation Debt**
- **Issue**: Code without good docs won't get adopted
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact**: High
- **Mitigation**: Write docs alongside code, not after

## Open Questions

1. **Naming**: Is "HtmlGraph" the right name? Alternatives:
   - WebGraph
   - HtmlDB
   - GraphML (might conflict with existing GraphML format)
   - HyperGraph (too generic)

2. **Licensing**: MIT vs Apache 2.0?
   - MIT is simpler, more permissive
   - Apache has patent protection

3. **Monetization**: Is there a business model here?
   - Consulting/training?
   - Enterprise features (SQLite indexer, hosting)?
   - SaaS dashboard?

4. **Scope**: Should we include graph visualization in MVP?
   - Pro: More impressive demos
   - Con: Adds complexity, dependencies

5. **Standards**: Should we propose this as a W3C standard?
   - Pro: Legitimacy, wider adoption
   - Con: Slow process, may constrain evolution
